- **Quotes**
	- The world splits open, and nothing makes sense. Your life was normal, and now, suddenly, it’s anything but normal
	- The injustice of these second losses makes grief itself that much more difficult.
	- Being allowed to tend to your grief, without feeling like you need to fix it or clean it up, makes grief, itself, easier
	- Sometimes grief like yours cannot be held by the universe itself. True. Sometimes grief needs more than an endless galaxy
	- Grief strips life down to its irreducible essentials. In that visceral state, your distance from the “normal” world can feel insurmountable. There’s an uncomfortable truth here: you are not like other people. Not right now. The world has been split open. Things “ordinary,” non-grieving people do as a matter of course will not always make sense, or feel meaningful, to you.
	- Grief itself won’t make sense, loss itself will not rearrange into something orderly and sensible, but your mind, and your heart, will adapt. This loss will be absorbed and integrated. It’s what your heart and mind are made for: adapting to new experiences. Not good, not bad—it is simply what they do.
	- Insisting that we have hope in some kind of positive outcome is just another way our culture’s insistence on transformation and a happy ending shows itself. I can’t hope like that. If we change our orientation to hope—moving from what we might get, to how we might get there—then hope is a concept I can get behind. We might not hope for a specific physical outcome, but instead hope to live this experience of loss in a way that is beautiful and personally meaningful.
	- Grief is difficult on everything; relationships are not immune. There will be people who can handle the choppy relationship bits and make it through with you.
	- We grieve because we love. Grief is part of love. There was love in this world before your loss, there is love surrounding you now, and love will remain beside you, through all the life that is yet to come. The forms will change, but love itself will never leave. It’s not enough. And it’s everything.
	- Finding your middle way inside grief is about finding friendship with your own heart, making a home inside your own heart. It’s in learning to bear witness to your own pain, in treating yourself like someone you love. It’s about claiming your right to be in pain, without cleaning it up or making it pretty for someone else’s comfort. It’s about finding those who can share this path with you, who are not afraid to see your heart in all its pain and all its grace.
