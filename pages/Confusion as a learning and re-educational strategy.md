- [[Perplexed? Embrace it! Confusion is a symptom of learning | Psyche Ideas]]
- Confusion can be a catalyst for **accelerated learning** - it puts the learner in a situation where they've to infer, diagnose, solve problems, engage in a deeper inquiry, produce explanations, and demonstrate application of the learned theory.
- When the confusion level is too high, it can lead to higher levels of frustrations. In the [[Books/The Eighty Five Percent Rule for Optimal Learning]], [[Robert Wilson]] said the optimal [[degree of difficulty]] without causing learners to give up on learning, is 85%-15% success-error rates. In other words, learners must get it right about 85% of the time, in order to learn a concept.
- Feeling confused can also be very useful when the task requires us to re-learn a concept: that is, to overcome misconceptions, address biases or blind spots, in order to develop a fuller, and more accurate, understanding of a set of facts. It makes us more alert, focused and cognitively engaged with material at hand.
