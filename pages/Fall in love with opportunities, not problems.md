- [[The Problem With Problems - by John Cutler]]
- There're two sides to a problem: (1) is the problem worth solving now? and (2) can this be problem be solved within a given constraint? Every problem is worth looking into it - but is that problem the highest leverage one that I or the team could work on? What is the opportunity of solving this problem? What are we shutting doors on if we work on this problem?
- Opportunities are problems that has a feasible path to making some progress or impact (even if that path is about learning whether the problem exists). The problem is not the problem itself; rather, it is the viability, feasibility, leverage of the opportunity that we need to think about.
- Problem definitions are inherently political When things go wrong, blame is high. We may blame the person who defined the problem for misdefining the problem, or the person who is responsible for delivering the solution in an ineffective manner.
- The trick is not to fall in love with problems but to fall in love with opportunities. When we shift into [[opportunity-mapping]] , we start to build shared understanding amongst everyone involved, and focus less on having a 'well-defined' problem space.
