			- "End-of-life doulas (EOLDs) explicitly draw from this nomenclature and model, providing informed companionship and resources before, during, and after death. In some regions, support may include after-death care of the body and funeral planning education or services."
			- Example roles: death midwife, death doula, end of life consultant, death caregiver, death walker.
			- The most common words or category of words used to describe the role were **support**(across practical, emotional, physical, and spiritual domains), **educate** (providing resources, information, and teaching practical skills; ‘naturalizing’ the dying process), and **empower** (increasing individuals’ and families’ capacity to make end-of-life decisions and/or provide care; enhancing the larger community’s ability to ‘reclaim’ dying).
			- A secondary group of common descriptors included *companion and presence* (to listen, take time and ‘hold space’), *advocate and champion* (enhance the voice of individuals and families), *coordinate, collaborate, and facilitate* (linking information and services within and between families, communities, health care systems), *mediate and guide* (navigate through myriad end-of-life processes; relationship and communication issues), and *assess and plan* (evaluating client and family needs; structured conversations about advance care and legal planning; after-death wishes).
			- the role also included *after-death care and funereal work* (providing hands-on services or instruction to wash and dress the body, how to keep the body at home, transportation to funeral home, and/or home funerals, celebrancy, and burial)

			- Research on informal conversations about  personal troubles has shown how this type of talk is socially constrained. For example, people do not simply discuss their troubles at any point in a conversation. Rather, they use specific communicative actions to build a conversational environment that is conducive to the articulation and sympathetic reception of a trouble (3). For example, people generally do not introduce their troubles abruptly into conversations; instead, they work their way towards them (4), or they give clues that there might be a trouble and then report it when their interlocutor asks about it (5). Exiting troubles talk is also socially constrained and involves a series of stepwise moves (6).

			- Since most East Asian countries are influenced by the Confucianism and the concept of ‘filial piety (a virtue and primary duty to respect and care of parents and senior relatives),’ patient autonomy is consequently subordinate to family values ([29–32]
			   and physician authority ([33]. The dominance from family members and physicians during a patient’s EOL decision-making is recognized as a cultural feature in Asia.\
			- It is assumed that the patient might be unable to accept the truth of poor disease prognosis psychologically.
			- Indonesia: It is recommended that a competent patient is provided sufficient information prior to complete and sign an AD. A palliative care team is suggested to play the role of initiating the discussion with the patient. In a case an incompetent patient has no AD, the family may provide a consensus based on patient’s best interest as guidance for health-care professionals.
			- Indonesia: Illness is a shared family affair, where communicating EOL to the patient is considered as a taboo ([52]()). Family plays a central role in health-care decision making in Indonesia, particularly for the elderly population.
			- Singapore: the intention of allowing an individual to sign in advance a legal document to inform one’s doctor that one does not want the use of any extraordinary LST to prolong life, in the event that one is terminally ill and mentally incapacitated from making decisions ([96]). However, the AMD applies only to a very narrow scenario and as a document, does not adequately address the broad spectrum of advance decisions (AD) that can be explored as well as the values and personhood underlying such decisions for any individual.
			- Singapore: 53% of all doctors are comfortable discussing death and dying with their patients but only 31% of nurses are comfortable discussing death
			- Singapore: Anecdotally, within a hospital system in Singapore, only ~40% of patients were able to participate in the conversation and the large majority of the conversations were carried out with the loved ones of the patients. In the absence of decision-making capacity of the patient at the point of ACP facilitation, the question posed to the patient’s loved ones is what they think the patient would have wanted.
			- Singapore: 14.4% of participants had heard of ACP, mainly through the media (67.9%), from family and friends (21.4%) and health-care providers (21.4%). 26.8% of those who had heard of ACP knew how to begin an ACP discussion and 12.5% of them had a prior ACP discussion. After explanation of what ACP entails, 60.1% of participants were willing to begin an ACP discussion.
			- Taiwan: The Patient Right to Autonomy Act was passed by the Legislative Yuan in Taiwan in the end of 2016 and enacted on 6 January 2019. This Act is established to ensure respect for patient autonomy, protect the right of patients to a good and natural death and promote harmonious physician–patient relationship. It advocates AD through the process of ACP consultation
			- Taiwan: The Patient Right to Autonomy Act goes one step further compared with the Natural Death Act; it is applicable to healthy people, the content includes issues related to artificial hydration and nutrition as well as LSTs; and it could only be amended by the patient himself or herself.
