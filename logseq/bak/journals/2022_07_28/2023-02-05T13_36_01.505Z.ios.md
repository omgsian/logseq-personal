	- **Before support**
		- Figure out what support they need
	- **During support**
		- How do we manage the whole experience on the listener's side?
	- Many listeners don't have enough support for themselves e.g. structured courses, training & development
	- Listening is not treated with the same depth or respect it deserves
	- How do you train listeners?
	- Number of listeners are way too few
	- How do we create a good learning community to facilitate good listening over Zoom?
	- Finding good listeners
		- For social workers: why do more listening when they already are doing the listening at work?
		- For not so good listeners: they bring enthusiasm but requires a lot of guidance
	- Designing service experience design
