		- “There's a certain art to becoming who you are. There's no standard kit you can use to assemble yourself, swapping out parts as needed. Instead, it feels more like a kind of stretching, a teasing out at the edges, like a glassblower standing at the furnace.”
		- “If you'd only stop to seize the day, you could hold on to it and carry it with you. But the truth is, most of life is forgotten instantly, almost as it's happening. Chances are that even a day like today will slip through your fingers and dissolve into oblivion, washed clean by the tides.”
		- “starlornn. a sense of loneliness looking up at the night sky, feeling like a castaway marooned in the middle of the ocean, whose currents are steadily carrying off all other castawaysâ€”entire worlds and stars whose only remnant is a scrap of light they flung overboard centuries ago, a message in a bottle that's only just now washing up on our shores”
		- “The more you look to the sky, the more you find yourself back on Earth, confronting certain possibilities. It's possible there are other names for our planet that we will never know. That there are constellations that feature our sun, from an angle we'll never get to see.”
		- “the whipgraft delusionn. the phenomenon in which you catch your reflection in the mirror and get the sense that you're peering into the eyes of a stranger, as if you're looking at a police sketch of your own face aged forward twenty years, which would imply that the real you is out there somewhere, wandering the streets of your old neighborhood, still at large.”
		- “ddleworthadj. unable to settle the question of whether you're doing okay in life; feeling torn between conflicting value systems and moveable goalposts, which makes you long for someone to come”
		- “We're all just exchanging glances, trying to tell each other who we are. Trying to catch a glimpse of ourselves, feeling around in the darkness.”
		- “When your life moves on to the next scene, theirs flickers in place, wrapped in a cloud of backstory and inside jokes and characters strung together with countless other stories you'll never be able to see. That you'll never know exist. In which you might appear only once. As an extra sipping coffee in the background. As a blur of traffic passing on the highway. As a lighted window at dusk.”
		- “Soon after you were born, you were put in a little box with a label slapped on it. It was nothing personalâ€”and that was kind of the point. It was an easy way to keep things organized, so people could size you up at a glance and didn't have to think about what was inside.”
		- “epistrixn. a disconcerting cluster of endings that all seem to happen at once; a random barrage of departures and closures and divorces and series finales and celebrity deaths, which leaves you anxiously aware that the author of your story seems to be wrapping up an awful lot of loose ends.”
		- “There will always be a certain lingering question you keep asking about yourself, that never really goes away: to what degree are you responsible? Any clear and unambiguous answer is surely doomed to be a fantasy. So you might as well learn to live with the mystery. Forgive yourself or hold yourself accountable. Try to be yourself or try to be better. Let go or don't let go. Whatever helps you sleep at night.”
		- “It's strange to think that some of those lights in the distance might be looking right back at you, just barely able to make out the lamp shining over your back door from three miles away. There might even be a few people peering down from a plane passing overhead, wondering to themselves what it's like to be standing right where you're standing, and they might even be feeling a sense of loss, knowing they'll never have time to explore your corner of the world.”
		- “insoucismn. the inability to decide how much sympathy your situation really deserves, knowing that so many people have it far worse and others far better, that some people would need years of therapy to overcome what you have, while others would barely think to mention it in their diary that day.”
		- “watashiaton. curiosity about the impact you've had on the lives of the people you know, wondering which of your harmless actions or long-forgotten words might have altered the plot of their stories in ways you'll never get to see.”
		- “And when she's alone, she's someone else entirely, a person you'll never get a chance to meet.”
		- “You tried packaging and repackaging your identity in different combinations, until you began to feel like you belong, and could wear your labels proudly.But there's a part of you that never found a home, rattling around in categories that never really did you justice.”
		- “If our houses ever feel haunted, it'll be because we're haunting them ourselves, trying to revisit all the places we once knew. ”
		- “moriturismn. a tiny jolt of awareness that someday you will die, which leaves you lying awake in bed whispering silently to yourself, Oh, right, this is it; an unsettling reminder that your life is not just a game you're playing or a story you'll be telling later, but your one and only glimpse of what the universe has to offer, like a kid waking up in the back seat of the family car at night, having just pulled into a bright neon gas station, looking around for a moment or two, before settling back in for the long road trip, sleeping for miles and miles off into the dark.”
		- “we just have to have the courage to do it. To decide for ourselves which fleeting, precious, interminable moments we'll carry with us right to the end”
		- “The story of humanity is a move from the countryside to the big city. But it's happened so fast that our brains are still stuck in the hinterlands. There's a part of you that longs to leave your car idling in traffic, hop the fence, and flee into the forest. To wander for miles through open territory, forced by fate to live in the moment, your eyes glued to the horizon, your ears tuned to the rustling of leaves. To feel the lushness and harshness of the wild, the clarity of eating and killing and growing stronger. To live off the land without tools or simulations, and experience nature in all its simplicityâ€”raw, indifferent, and ferociously real.”
		- “You think over your life and realize how much of it is mythology, stories you tell yourself. How many half-hearted compliments have you taken to heart, how many of your friendships are kept together by little more than circumstance?”
		- “feresyn. the fear that your partner is changing in ways you don't understand, even though they might be changes for the better, because it forces you to wonder whether your relationship needs a few careful nudges to fall back into balance, or perhaps is still as stable as ever, but involves a person who no longer exists.”
		- “drissonn. an unexpected twinge of attraction for a friend; a flutter of desire you don't necessarily want to feel, that didn't even seem possible up until this point, when it suddenly becomes a problem you have to deal with.”
		- “wenbaneadj. feeling small and alone while walking the streets of an unfamiliar city, swept along in the commercial bustle of asphalt and neon, dwarfed by impenetrable monoliths looming high overhead, brushed aside by pulses of traffic carrying on their daily business, with nobody willing to look you in the eye except for the posters encrusted on subway walls, each of them pitching at someone other than you.”
		- “One by one, you'd patch things up with old friends, enjoying one last conversation before you meet and go your separate ways.”
		- “craxisn. the unease of knowing how quickly your circumstances could change on youâ€”that no matter how carefully you shape your life into what you want it to be, the whole thing could be overturned in an instant, with little more than a single word, a single step, a phone call out of the blue, and by the end of next week you might already be looking back on this morning as if it were a million years ago, a poignant last hurrah of normal life.”
		- “Even right at the start of things, you can feel the sense of an ending. The way you're still only settling into vacation while mentally preboarding your flight home, or how soon after starting a new relationship you start to wonder exactly how this one ends.”
		- “ne'er-be-gonen. a person who has no idea where their home is, or was, or when they might have left itâ€”which leaves their emotional compass free to swing around wildly as they move from place to place, pulling them everywhere and nowhere all at once, making it that much harder to navigate.Middle English naur, nowhere + begone, surrounded. Pronounced â€œnair-bi-gawn.â€”
		- “aesthosisn. the state of feeling trapped inside your own subjective tastesâ€”not knowing why you find certain things beautiful or ugly, only that you doâ€”wishing you could remove the sociopsychological lenses from your eyes so you could see the beauty in anything and be moved to tears by the smell of burning garbage, the aria of a screaming toddler, or a neon Elvis painted on black velvet.”
		- “Perhaps there's a part of you that's instinctively wary of lingering too long in any one moment. We can breathe this world in, and hold on to it as long as we can, but we can't just stop there. We have to keep moving, digging around for some deeper meaning, hoping to find an escape hatch between one experience and the next.”
		- “the kinder surprisen. the point in your early adolescence when you realize that your parents are muddling through their lives the same as you; that many respectable adults are no less lost than you and your friends, no less petty and obsessive and insecure, which makes you wonder if there are no real adults, because such a thing never actually existed, except in bedtime stories.”
		- “kinchyadj. feeling guilty that you care about your own petty concerns more deeply than faraway cataclysmsâ€”that a family spat hurts more than a civil war, that a three-day fever hits you harder than climate change.”
		- “Maybe we should think of memory itself as an art form, in which the real work begins as soon as the paint hits the canvas. And a work of art is never finished, only abandoned.”
		- “Besides, there's some beauty left in echoesâ€”in knowing you have a part to play and playing it well, in concert with those around you. And there are those rare moments when you can let yourself go, close your eyes and let your body move with the orchestra, the way that old trees swing back and forth in a windstorm.”
		- “nodrophobian. the fear of irrevocable actions and irreversible processesâ€”knowing that a colorful shirt will fade a little more with every wash, that your tooth enamel is wearing away molecule by molecule, never to grow back.”
		- “We rarely think to hold on to that part of life. We don't build statues of ordinary people. We don't leave behind little plaques to commemorate the milestones of ordinary time:HERE ON THE TWENTY FIFTH OF MARCHNINETEEN HUNDRED AND NINETY FOURSOME NEIGHBORS WENT OUT WALKING THEIR DOGSTHE CHILDREN TOOK TURNS HOLDING THE LEASHIT WAS A FUN AFTERNOON FOR EVERYONE INVOLVEDBut it all still happened. All those cheap and disposable experiences are no less real than anything in our history books, no less sacred than anything in our hymnals.”
		- “tarrionn. an odd interval of blankness you feel after something big happens to you but before you feel the resulting emotional reaction”
		- “when there is free rein to improvise, you find yourself feeding off other people's moods, matching their tones and energies, just trying to get along or make it through the day. Inside your head, you imagine yourself as a shade of neutral gray that just happens to reflect whatever strong colors are nearby.”
		- “Maybe you were always destined to be sitting right where you're sitting. Or maybe it's a miracle that you managed to meet the people you did, knowing how many obstacles might have gotten in the way. ”
		- “anechosisn. a state of exhaustion with continually being told what you want to hear, whether by marketers pandering to you or acquaintances afraid of causing offense; the longing for someone to have the heart to finally call you out on your bullshit, challenge your long-held assumptions, and push you to become a better personâ€”which would be a far deeper kindness than trying to live and let live.”
		- “anchoragen. the desire to hold on to time as it passes, like trying to keep your grip on a rock in the middle of a river, feeling the weight of the current against your chest while your elders float on downstream, calling over the roar of the rapids, â€œJust let goâ€”it's okayâ€”let go.â€”
		- “As the song says: â€œLong live the high tide and long live the low, but above all, long live the difference.â€”
		- “eftlessadj. mildly disappointed that you'll never be able to attend your own memorial service; frustrated that you could spend your entire life trying to build some sort of legacy to leave behind, but just barely miss your chance to catch a glimpse of what that legacy might be.”
		- “idlewildadj. feeling grateful to be stranded in a place where you can't do much of anythingâ€”sitting for hours at an airport gate, the sleeper car of a train, or the backseat of a van on a long road tripâ€”which temporarily alleviates the burden of being able to do anything at any time and frees up your brain to do whatever it wants to do, even if it's just to flicker your eyes across the passing landscape.”
		- “You may well adore the life you have for everything it is. You know it isn't groundbreaking, but you wouldn't change a thing. Still, you can't shake the feeling that something is missing.Maybe the trouble is, you were never really â€œin itâ€ to begin with. Maybe when you first started building the life you wanted, you put so much thought into what might happen that you started losing sight of what was happening. ”
		- “fitchingv. intr. compulsively turning away from works of art you find frustratingly, nauseatingly goodâ€”wanting to shut off the film and leave the theater, or devour a book only in maddening little chunksâ€”because it resonates at precisely the right frequency to rattle you to your core, which makes it mildly uncomfortable to be yourself.”
		- “lookabackn. the shock of meeting back up with someone and learning that your mental image of them had fallen wildly out of dateâ€”having grown up or gotten old, fallen apart or pulled themselves togetherâ€”which shakes your faith in the accuracy of the social puppet show that runs continuously inside your head.”
		- “xenon. the smallest measurable unit of human connection, typically exchanged between passing strangersâ€”a warm smile, a sympathetic nod, a shared laugh about some odd coincidenceâ€”moments that are fleeting and random but still contain powerful emotional nutrients that can alleviate the symptoms of feeling alone.”
		- “keirn. an ill-fated attempt to reenact a beloved memory years later, returning to a place that once felt like home, only to find it now feels uncannily off, like walking through a wax museum of your own childhood.”
		- “lisolian. the satisfaction of things worn down by timeâ€”broken-in baseball mitts, the shiny snout of a lucky bronze pig, or footprints ground deep into floorboards by generations of kneeling monks.”
		- “ecsisn. the haunting sense of mystery infused into certain random details that beckons you to wonder how it ended up here at this point in timeâ€”marveling at a patch of white on a dog's chest, a bubble trapped in an old window, a glimpse of Saturn's rings shivering in a telescope lensâ€”knowing that behind the thing itself is a long chain of causes and effects that veers off into the shadows of prehistory, anchored somewhere near the dawn of time, even though the end result is somehow right there in front of you, shimmering in place.”
		- “slipfastadj. longing to disappear completely; to melt into a crowd and become invisible, so you can take in the world without having to take part in itâ€”free to wander through conversations without ever leaving footprints, free to dive deep into things without worrying about making a splash.”
		- “heartspurn. an unexpected surge of emotion in response to a seemingly innocuous triggerâ€”the distinctive squeal of a rusty fence, a key change in an old pop song, the hint of a certain perfumeâ€”which feels all the more intense because you can't quite pin it down.”
		- “Inevitably you got hit, and you got hurt. You prided yourself on how well you absorbed the blow, bouncing back as if nothing had happened. But the pain changed you, in little chips and cracks that might take you years to notice. Over time you learned how to position yourself in very specific ways, protecting the most vulnerable parts of your psyche, even as you knew they were still a crucial part of the real you. Gradually you became more and more reluctant to move from that position. Growing a little harder, a little more brittle.”
		- “The eye is a keyhole through which the world pours in, and a world spills out. For a few seconds, you can peek through into a vault that contains everything they are. Catching a glimpse of their vulnerability, their pain, their humor, their vitality, their power over others, and what they demand of themselves.”
		- “ludiosisn. the sense that you're just making it up as you go alongâ€”knowing that if someone asked why you do most things, you couldn't really come up with a convincing explanation.”
		- “star-stuckadj. exhausted by endless reviews and secondhand impressions; itching to stumble blindly into the world and make some mistakes, to wander around opening doors to restaurants and performances and movies you've never heard of, without the slightest idea of what to expect.”
		- “o'erpinev. intr. to wander through the grounds of a cemetery, glancing over the gravestones as if you were people-watching the dead, imagining all the things they must have seen and the lives they might have led, trying to conjure up an entire biography from a handful of words and dates etched in granite, with barely more than a single dash to cover the unimaginable vastness of their experience.”
		- “Surely nothing is more empowering than knowing that you're free to do as you please. And yet there's something vaguely unsettling about it. There's a heaviness to the thought, when by all rights it should feel lofty and liberating. Because if it's true that you're in control of your own destiny, it must also be true that you alone are in control. That whatever fate ends up befalling you, it'll have your name written all over it. Which leaves you cursed with a feeling of perpetual responsibility, left with nobody to blame but yourself.”
		- “It's strange how little of the world you actually get to see. No matter where on Earth you happen to be standing, the horizon you see in the distance is only ever about three miles away from you, a bit less than five kilometers. Which means that at any given time, you're barely more than an hour's walk from a completely different world. Alas, even if you lace up your boots and take off for the hills, the circle of your horizon will follow you around like a prison searchlight. The gravel under your feet will always look gritty and literal; the mountains in the distance will always seem bluish and otherworldly. Which means your surroundings will always be infused with a certain ambivalence. Maybe this is where you belongâ€”or maybe there's something far better just over the next ridge. Without calibrating your perspective to the breadth of all possible options, you have no way of knowing. You'll always have to wonder.”
		- “Whatever resonates will stay, and what doesn't will fall away. To pick away at the literal truth is to miss the point of it, miss the joy of it.”
		- “dolonian. a state of unease prompted by people who seem to like you too much, which makes you wonder if they must have you confused with someone elseâ€”someone flawless, selfless, or easy to understand from a distanceâ€”feeling vaguely disappointed that they're unwilling to spend the time it takes getting to know the real you.”
		- “hubilancen. the quiet poignance of your own responsibility for someone, with a mix of pride and fear and love and humilityâ€”feeling a baby fall asleep on your chest, or driving at night surrounded by loved ones fast asleep, who trust you implicitly with their livesâ€”a responsibility that wasn't talked about or assigned to you, it was assumed to be yours without question.”
		- “You alone manage this particular storehouse of memories, being the only one to remember certain things, or the only one to forget.”
		- “midsummern. the point in your mid-twenties when your youthfulness expires as a valid excuse, leaving you accountable for your own station in life, even if you're still only reeling from your past or planning for the futureâ€”which somehow makes time itself feel more urgent than before, until even the springtime pollen floating in the air reminds you of the coming snow.”
		- “winnewawn. an unexpected burst of good news that only makes you skeptical, believing that every sudden rise in your fortunes must inevitably be accompanied by an impending fall, which leaves you feeling uneasy at the end of a really good day, waiting around for the punch line.”
		- “Other times, the impermanence of everything around us feels haunting. To think that a thousand-year-old cathedral won't always be there. That entire cities can be forgotten in a manner of decades, vibrant languages dwindled into obscurity, fearsome gods relinquished to old books, old books turned to dust.”
		- “ghoughn. a hollow place in your psyche that can never be filled; a bottomless hunger for more food, more praise, more attention, more affection, more joy, more sex, more money, more hours of sunshine, more years of your life; a state of panic that everything good will be taken from you too early, which makes you want to swallow the world before it ends up swallowing you.”
		- “malotypen. a certain person who embodies all the things you like the least about yourselfâ€”a seeming caricature of your worst tendenciesâ€”which leaves you feeling repulsed and fascinated in equal measure, having stumbled upon a role model of exactly the kind of person you never want to be.”
		- “middingn. the tranquil pleasure of being near a gathering but not quite in itâ€”hovering on the perimeter of a campfire, talking quietly outside a party, resting your eyes in the back seat of a car listening to friends chatting up frontâ€”feeling blissfully invisible yet still fully included, safe in the knowledge that everyone is together and everyone is okay, with all the thrill of being there without the burden of having to be.”
		- “There might be a big dramatic event going on that bends the course of our lives, except for certain people left out of the loop, who'll always have to wonder. ”
		- “aftergloomn. the pang of loneliness you feel the day after an intensely social event, as the glow of voices and laughter fades into a somber quiet.”
		- “Strange how strong the instinct is: to see something incredible and reach for a camera. As if you're trying to lend it some credibility. To prove that it's real. That I was here.”
		- “suerzan. a feeling of quiet amazement that you exist at all; a sense of gratitude that you were even born in the first place, that you somehow emerged alive and breathing despite all odds, having won an unbroken streak of reproductive lotteries that stretches all the way back to the beginning of life itself.”
		- “tornomovn. the weird hollowness of trying to imagine the distant futureâ€”struggling to place it in any sort of context you'd find relatable but straining to believe it could feel all that different from the world around you.”
		- “justingn. the habit of telling yourself that just one tweak could solve all of your problemsâ€”if only you had the right haircut, if only you found the right group of friends, if only you made a little more money, if only he noticed you, if only she loved you back, if only you could find the time, if only you were confidentâ€”which leaves you feeling perpetually on the cusp of a better life, hanging around the top of the slide waiting for one little push.From just, only, simply, merely + jousting, a sport won by positioning the tip of your lance at just the right spot, at just the right second. Pronounced â€œjuhst-ing.â€”
		- “You once had wild dreams and obstacles and risks looming all around you, but now those look smaller, too. You remember giants and goddesses and villains, but now all you see are ordinary people, assembled in their tiny classrooms and workspaces, each moving around in little steps, like tokens on a game board.”
		- “along and score your progress in discrete and measurable unitsâ€”points, dollars, friends, followers, or a grade point averageâ€”which may not clear up where you're going but would at least reassure you that you're one step closer to getting there.”
		- “ethernessn. the wistful feeling of looking around a gathering of loved ones, all too aware that even though the room is filled with warmth and laughter now, it won't always be this wayâ€”that the coming years will steadily break people away into their own families, or see them pass away one by one, until there comes a time when you'll look back and try to imagine what it felt like to have everyone together in the same place.”
		- “allopen. a mysterious aura of loneliness you feel in certain places; the palpable weight of all the lonely people secretly holed up in their houses and apartments, with a flickering blue glow cast up on their wallsâ€”so many of whom might just want someone to talk to, or just want to feel needed, and could be that for each other if only they could somehow connect.”
		- “mithennessn. the unsettling awareness that the rest of the world happily carries on in your absence, that although things only ever seem to change when you check back in for an update, they're unwilling to wait for you, and undergo massive shifts while your back is turnedâ€”your mother getting older, your old friends becoming different people, your hometown losing some of the hallmarks that made it feel like home.”
		- “When you loved someone, you loved them openly and with abandon, squeezing hugs as hard as you could.”
		- “karanoian. the terror of the blank page, which can feel both liberating and confining, in both the limitlessness of its potential and the looseness of its boundaries.”
		- “But where does she go from here? How long will it be before she's gazing over the rainbow once again? How long before she's galloping across the fields like a storm chaser, beckoning her arms to the clouds like a toddler desperate to be picked up?”
		- “trueholdingn. the act of trying to keep an amazing discovery to yourself, fighting the urge to shout about it from the rooftops because you're afraid that it'll end up being diluted and distorted, and will no longer have been created just for you.”
		- “barelevelingv. intr. trying to improve yourself without anyone else knowing about it, afraid that they'll think it's silly or grandiose or unnecessary, or that they'll end up calling too much attention to your efforts, transforming a casual tweak into a flashy rebranding campaign.”
		- “foilsickadj. feeling ashamed after revealing a little too much of yourself to someoneâ€”allowing them too clear a view of your pettiness, your anger, your cowardice, your childlike vulnerabilityâ€”wishing you could somehow take back the moment, discreetly bolting the door after a storm had already blown it off its hinges.”
		- “the more distant you are from other people, the more invulnerable they appear.You see yourself as you are, with your failures just as clear as your successes. But you see most other people on their termsâ€”only from the side they want you to see, like a statue on a high pedestal, stoic and confident.”
		- “As your twenties whirl into your thirties, you feel the circle begin to tighten, and all at once you realize it's a spiral, and you're already halfway through. You start to notice how much effort it takes just to hold on to what you haveâ€”catching up with friends, keeping up with your obligations, maintaining your possessions, clearing your head. As more of your day repeats itself, you keep trying to slow down and focus on the things that matter to you. You try to stay open to new experiences but find it harder and harder to resist the pull toward your center of gravity: the ballast of memories you hold on to,”
		- “Ã©nouementn. the bittersweetness of having arrived here in the future, finally learning the answers to how things turned out but being unable to tell your past self.”
		- “Eventually, the storm will pass, the skies will clear, and we'll pick up our lives just where we left them, no more urgently than before. We'll soak in the sunshine as if none of it mattered, forgetting the sense of fellowship we once found in the shelter.”
		- “volandern. the ethereal feeling of looking down at the world through an airplane window, able to catch a glimpse of far-flung places you'd never see in person, free to let your mind wander, trying to imagine what they must feel like down on the groundâ€”the closest you'll ever get to an objective point of view.”
		- “nementian. the post-distraction effort to recall the reason you're feeling particularly anxious or angry or excited, trying to retrace your sequence of thoughts like a kid gathering the string of a downed kite.”
		- “It makes you wish you could restore your self-image back to its essence. Painstakingly washing away the remnants of all the times you tried to be someone you're not. Cleaning up areas where people tried to paint over you or ripped away qualities they didn't like. Stripping down your identity, layer by layer, through all your habits and distractions and cultural programming, so you can finally reveal your true colors for all to see. But the more you look into who you are in isolation, the more your identity dissolves into a noise of random impulsesâ€”dust on a blank canvas.Maybe there is no single self to speak of.”
		- “You put yourself out there, trying to decide how much of the world to let in.”
		- “But there in the background, faint and out of focus, are the extras. The random passersby. Each living a life as vivid and complex as your own.”
		- “nyctousadj. feeling quietly overjoyed to be the only one awake in the middle of the nightâ€”sitting alone with a laptop and a cup of tea or strolling down the center line of an abandoned streetâ€”taking in the world like an empty theater between productions, stripped down to a simple black box, open to be whatever you want it to be.”
		- “spinning playback headn. the disorienting feeling of meeting back up with an old friend and realizing that you've become different people on divergent pathsâ€”that even though they're standing right in front of you, the person you once knew isn't really there anymore.”
		- “You might be tempted to define yourself by victimhood or self-diagnosis, as if all of your flaws were merely symptoms of some huge systemic problem outside your control.”
		- “You think of all the places you'll never have time to explore, some of which might feel like the home you never had, or like a living hell, or like walking around on another planet. You might one day be able to visit one or two or ten of these places, but you'll never be able to shake the feeling that with every step you take, a thousand more lights will appear”
		- “flichtishadj. nervously aware how much of your self-image is based on untested assumptions about yourselfâ€”only ever guessing how you'd react to a violent threat, a sudden windfall, a huge responsibility, or being told to do something you knew was wrong.”
		- “lilon. a friendship that can lie dormant for years only to pick right back up instantly, as if you'd seen each other last weekâ€”which is all the more remarkable given that certain other people can make every lull in conversation feel like an eternity.”
		- “heartwormn. a relationship or friendship that you can't get out of your head, which you thought had faded long ago but is still somehow alive and unfinished, like an abandoned campsite whose smoldering embers still have the power to start a forest fire.”
		- “You may never get comfortable living life on your own. Maybe you'll never get over the initial shock of existing at all, and will spend your life as a perpetual newcomer, still trying to catch your breath, right until the last. But know that at the very least, you're in good company. Ask any one of us, and we'll tell you: you're not alone.”
		- “It's easy to forget that most of your memories happened in places that are still around, the walls mostly unchanged, carrying on in your absence. But the world you once knew, and the people you still remember, have long since moved on, replaced by so many others who have passed through these doors.”
		- “achenian. the maddening sense that the world is too complex to even begin to understand, that whenever you try to answer even the most trivial question, it quickly tangles into a thicket of complications and melts into a quicksand of nuance, leaving you flailing for something solid to hold on to, struggling to come up with anything you could say that is definitively 100 percent true.”
		- “There's a certain kinship there, shared by all things. The stars and the tombstones, the family dog and the honeybees. A comfort to think that we are all united in our impermanence.”
		- “zielschmerzn. the dread of finally pursuing a lifelong dream, which requires you to put your true abilities out there to be tested on the open savannah, no longer protected inside the terrarium of hopes and delusions that you started up in kindergarten and kept sealed as long as you could.”

You'd know from the start which week was the happiest you'll ever be, so you could cherish every second of it, soaking it in while it lasts.”
		- “kadotn. fear of the prospect of not existing one day, feeling like a student about to graduate from the universe, on the cusp of a transition you don't feel ready for.”
		- “There's some beauty left in mystery. The beauty of knowing that the ocean is still mostly uncharted, inhabited by creatures nobody's ever seen, except for the scars they leave on the faces of whales”
		- “We need these silly little things to fill out our lives, even if they don't mean all that much. If only to remind us that the stakes were never all that high in the first place. It's not always life-and-death. Sometimes it's just lifeâ€”and that's alright.”
		- “proluctancen. the paradoxical urge to avoid doing something you've been looking forward toâ€”opening a decisive letter, meeting up with a friend who's finally back in town, reading a new book from your favorite authorâ€”perpetually waiting around for the right state of mind, stretching out the bliss of anticipation as long as you can.”
		- “You look around with a new sense of gratitude, taking in the complexity of things: raindrops skittering down a window, tall trees leaning in the wind, clouds of cream swirling in your coffee. Everything falls quiet, and the words start to lose their meaning. It all seems to mix together, until you can't tell the difference between the ordinary and the epic.”
		- “on tenderhooksadj. feeling the primal satisfaction of being needed by someone, which makes you feel that much more rooted to the world, even if the roots belong to someone else.”
		- “To keep pouring your heart into something, even if it falls on deaf ears. Reaching out in the face of indifference, just trying to give people permission to care.Indifference is easy. It takes a lot of courage to fight back against it. So maybe we should stop and count ourselves lucky that there's still someone out there, fighting the good fight.”
		- “Maybe it's not so bad to dwell on the past, as long as it brings you closer to the truth. If nothing else, it's a way to push back against the oversimplification of time.”
		- “Still, every once in a while you catch yourself humming along to some silly pop song that once broke your heart at sixteen, trying to tap back into that feeling again”
		- “Maybe then we'd feel a little more at home in this mostly unknowable universe, making our peace with the chaos of it, even finding comfort in the responsibility it gives us. What might be out there? Nobody knows!”
		- “Or do you accept the humble beauty of ordinary life, where nothing ever changes, and everything is simple? Which will it beâ€”Kansas or Oz? Life as it is or life as it could be?”
		- “altschmerzn. a sense of weariness with the same old problems that you've always had, the same boring issues and anxieties you've been gnawing on for decades, which makes you want to spit them out and dig up some fresher pain you might have buried in your mental backyard.”
		- “Everyone around you seems to have such a vibrant color of personality. It shines through vividly in everything they do, from the shoes they wear, to the groceries they put in their cart, to the precise wording of a text wishing you a happy birthday. You'd think it would all seem generic, but somehow every detail is quintessentially them.”
		- “You would have looked across the room at this same face, and struggled to imagine life without them, telling yourself that it was always meant to be. As if you had known all along that your paths would cross eventually.”
		- “sison. a solitary experience you wish you could have shared with someone elseâ€”having dinner in a romantic setting, reaching the summit after an arduous climb, having a run-in with a crazy stranger that nobody's going to believeâ€”which makes you look around for confirmation that it even happened at all.”
		- “If the past is a foreign country, we're only tourists. We can't expect to understand the locals or why they do what they do. We can only ask them to hold still, so we can capture a photo to take home with us. So we can pretend to ourselves that we've learned anything at all about who they were, and what it was like to live in another time.”
		- “such is the rhythm of ordinary time. Filled with long, featureless stretches we tend to skip over to get to the good parts.”
		- “caucicadj. afraid that the rest of your life is already laid out in front of you, that you're being swept inexorably along a series of predictable milestonesâ€”from school to graduation to career to marriage to kids to retirement to deathâ€”which makes you wish you could pull off to the side of the road for a little while, to stretch your legs and spread out the map so you can double-check that you're headed the right way.”
		- “That one day soon we'll tire of exploring and move back home for good. And we'll get used to watching our feet as we walk, occasionally stopping to hurl a single probe into the abyss, like a message in a bottle.”
		- “deep gutn. a resurgent emotion that you hadn't felt in years, that you might have forgotten about completely if your emotional playlist hadn't accidentally been left on shuffle.”
		- “symptomanian. the fantasy that there's some elaborate diagnosis out there that neatly captures the kind of person you are, tying together your many flaws and contradictions into a single themeâ€”which wouldn't necessarily sort out the mess inside your head but would at least let you mark it with a little sign so people know to walk around it.”
		- “immerensisn. the maddening inability to understand the reasons why someone loves youâ€”almost as if you're selling them a used car that you know has a ton of problems and requires daily tinkering just to get it to run normally, but no matter how much you try to warn them, they seem all the more eager to hop behind the wheel and see where this puppy can go.”
		- “burn upon reentryn. the bitter disappointment upon finding no new messages after spending hours out of contact, as if the world had barely even noticed you had left.”
		- “It's an open question why we sort ourselves into categories. Maybe it's the only way to stay sane in a society full of strangers, so you don't have to wade through a thicket of individuals just to pay for your groceries. We put people in boxes to get on with our day, to feel connected with each other, or feel like we're a part of something, because we're afraid that if there was nothing to contain us, we'd melt into the air.”
		- “solla, solla, sollan. an incantation whispered privately to yourself to celebrate the loss of something or someone you loved, which almost makes it feel like a deliberate renunciation, consciously deciding to relinquish them to an earlier part of your life.”
		- “arroian. the wish that you could've enjoyed a dry run of your lifeâ€”muddling through once quickly, then going back to do it all over again, this time for real.”
		- “There's a certain art to becoming who you are. There's no standard kit you can use to assemble yourself, swapping out parts as needed. Instead, it feels more like a kind of stretching, a teasing out at the edges, like a glassblower standing at the furnace.”
		- “if someone were to ask you on your deathbed what it was like to live here on Earth, perhaps the only honest answer would be: â€œI don't know. I passed through it once, but I've never really been there.â€”
		- “There's a certain art to becoming who you are. There's no standard kit you can use to assemble yourself, swapping out parts as needed. Instead, it feels more like a kind of stretching, a teasing out at the edges, like a glassblower standing at the furnace.”
		- “redesisn. a feeling of queasiness while offering someone advice, knowing they might well face a totally different set of constraints and capabilities, any of which might propel them to a wildly different outcomeâ€”which makes you wonder if all of your hard-earned wisdom is fundamentally nontransferable, like handing someone a gift card in your name that probably expired years ago”
		- “While falling asleep at night, she might be thinking over the parts of herself that make her feel proud, or self-conscious, or ashamed, trying to be a better person, even questioning the very traits that you love most about her.”
		- “Taking our chances out in the open, meeting each other as we are, in all our wholeness and strangeness. Finally gathering the courage to ask, â€œWhat is it like being you?â€â€”while being brave enough to admit that we don't already know the answer.Maybe it'll mean that we've finally arrived, unpacking the boxes to make ourselves at home. ”
		- “Time is an odd sort of currency. You're free to spend it or squander it as you will, but no matter how you choose to budget your remaining years, they're only ever dispensed in tiny micropayments, cent by cent, heartbeat by heartbeat, tick after tock after tick.Which means you have no way of knowing how much of it you have left.”
		- “furoshan. the eerie tranquility of fast-moving clouds, who pass through your patch of sky like a drifter stepping into your entryway to warm up for a minute, ruffling the ice from his beard before he nods his gratitude and turns back into the air.”
		- “Whenever life feels chaotic and uncertain and everything runs together, words offer us a sense of clarity and definition, with clean lines that separate one thing from another.”
		- “Right from the beginning, each of us has to confront a certain fundamental paradox: in order to be anywhere, you have to be somewhere. You have to confine yourself to just one body, inhabiting only one place at a time.”
		- “You begin to wonder if you've spent your entire life buoyed by airy delusions, coasting along on unearned confidence. But if it's possible to carry on that way indefinitely and not even notice, does it even matter whether any of it is real?”
		- “ochisian. the fear that the role you once occupied in someone's life could be refilled without a second thought, which makes you wish that every breakup would include a severance package, a non-compete clause, and some sort of romantic placement program”
		- “sithelessadj. feeling wistful upon brushing past a person you once shared a life withâ€”noticing the same touch on the arm, seeing the same smile, hearing the same laugh you used to adoreâ€”suddenly all too aware that it's no longer for you, and no longer carries the meaning it once did.”
		- “You never really get used to the feeling of being an individual. How strange it is that you're born alone and die alone.”
		- “clockwiseadj. aware that you'll only ever be a certain age relative to your loved ones, only seeing them from one arbitrary angle across the decadesâ€”never knowing your mother in her rebellious youth, never seeing your grandkid as anything other than a kidâ€”because even though your life spans do happen to overlap, they'll never quite line up.”
		- “You thought you were following the arc of the story, but you keep finding yourself immersed in passages you don't understand. Either everything seems important or nothing does.”
		- “Eventually with the benefit of years, you began to notice shifts too subtle to register from one day to the next. How quickly a bouquet starts to wilt, how a fringe of white sweeps over your father's hair. You keep reminding yourself to make peace with the churn. But for some reason you still find yourself shocked when things change in ways you didn't see coming”
		- “wildredadj. feeling the haunting solitude of extremely remote placesâ€”a clearing in the forest, a windswept field of snow, a rest area in the middle of nowhereâ€”which makes you feel like you've just intruded on a conversation that had nothing to do with you, where even the gravel beneath your feet and the trees overhead are holding themselves back to a pointed, inhospitable silence.”
		- “loss of backingn. an abrupt collapse of trust in yourselfâ€”having abandoned a resolution, surrendered to your demons, or squandered an opportunity you swore you'd take seriously this timeâ€”which resets your expectations and makes it that much harder to guarantee that your word is worth anything, even to yourself.”
		- “You have to love. You have to feel. It is the reason you are here on earth. You are here to risk your heart. You are here to be swallowed up. And when it happens that you are broken, or betrayed, or left, or hurt, or death brushes near, let yourself sit”
		- “mauerbauertraurigkeitn. the inexplicable urge to push people away, even close friends whose company you generally enjoyâ€”like a poker player who keeps folding a promising hand in order to avoid the pain of losing, or tamp down the urge to go all-in.”
		- “hemeisisn. the off-putting awareness of how deeply your culture's norms are ingrained in your psycheâ€”arbitrarily defining what you find shameful and admirable, private and communal, attractive and repulsive, fair and unfairâ€”as if you'd been programmed in a way that you can't control or even perceive, until you happen to encounter someone who has slightly different code.”
		- “tirosyn. a complicated feeling of envy and admiration for people younger than youâ€”their eyes shining with energy, their futures rich with potential, their confidence smooth and untouched”
		- “And what can life be worth if the first rehearsal for life is life itself?”
		- “everthelessn. the fear that this is ultimately as good as your life is ever going to getâ€”that the ebb and flow of your fortunes is actually just now hitting its high-water mark, and soon enough you'll sense the tide of life slowly begin to recede.”
		- “vulture shockn. the nagging sense that no matter how many days you spend exploring a foreign country, you never quite manage to step foot in itâ€”instead floating high above the culture like a diver over a reef, too dazzled by its exotic quirks to notice its problems and complexities and banalities, while drawing from the heavy tank of assumptions that you carry on your back wherever you go.”
		- “welliumn. an excuse you come up with to rationalize a disappointing outcomeâ€”telling yourself you weren't in the mood for that sold-out show anyway, that your safety school is actually a better fit, that your dream job might have been a bit too stressful.”
		- “Whenever you stumble on a new situation, it's hard to predict which version of you is going to emerge, or which opinion is going to tumble out from the gumball machine in your head”
		- “dead reckoningv. intr. finding yourself bothered by somebody's death more than you would have expected, even if they were only an abstract presence in your life, like a lighthouse in the distance that suddenly goes dark, leaving you with one less landmark to navigate by.”
		- “ledsomeadj. feeling lonely in a crowd; drifting along in a sea of anonymous faces but unable to communicate with or confide in any of them.”
		- “daguerreologuen. an imaginary conversation with an old photo of yourself, in which you might offer them a word of adviceâ€”to banish your worries, soak it all in, or shape up before it's too lateâ€”or maybe just ask them if they thought you had done justice to the life they built for you.”
		- “ The more you repeat an experience, the less you feel its impact, almost as if your brain is gradually tuning out the world.”
		- “beloiterv. intr. to look around in a state of mild astonishment that your life is somehow still going, as if a part of you had just assumed that your allotment of days would've been used up by now, standing there like a player at a slot machine, perpetually surprised that your winnings continue to trickle out, but not sure what you're supposed to do now.”

		- “agnosthesian. the state of not knowing how you really feel about something, which forces you to sift through clues hidden in your own behavior, as if you were some other personâ€”noticing a twist of acid in your voice, an obscene amount of effort you put into something trifling, or an inexplicable weight on your shoulders that makes it difficult to get out of bed.”
		- “vicarousadj. curious to know what someone else would do if they were in your shoes, eager to watch another actor put their own spin on the character of Youâ€”carrying your body differently, speaking in a tone you never use, saying and doing things you didn't even know were an optionâ€”a performance that might well end in disaster but would at least remind you that there are many different ways to play this role, even though you tend to assume you're just reading the lines as written.”
		- “falesian. the disquieting awareness that someone's importance to you and your importance to them may not necessarily matchâ€”that your best friend might only think of you as a buddy, that someone you barely know might consider you a mentor, that someone you love unconditionally might have one or two conditions.”
		- “We're all just people. We go to work and play our roles as best we can, spinning our tales and performing our tricks, but then we take off our makeup and go home, where we carry on with our real lives. None of us really knows what is happening, what we're doing, where we're going, or why. Still we carry on, doing what we can to get through it.”
		- “enterhoodn. the set of living people who have known you all your life, all the way back to your infancy, before you had a clue who you were; a group that slowly shrinks as you get older, until the point when all of your closest confidants have only ever seen an abridged version of you, having joined your story somewhere in the middle of things, just as you did.”
		- “amentalion. the sadness of realizing that you're already forgetting sense memories of the departedâ€”already struggling to hear their voice, picture the exact shade of their eyes, or call to mind the quirky little gestures you once knew by heart.”
		- “And yet, somewhere deep down, you find yourself rooting for the storm, hoping for the worst. As if a part of you is tired of waiting, wondering when the world will fall apartâ€”by lot, by fate, by the will of the gods. Almost daring them to grant your wish. But really, you can wish all you want, because life is a game of chance. And each passing day is another flip of the coin.”
		- “the Tiln. the reservoir of all possible opportunities still available to you at this point in your lifeâ€”all the countries you still have the energy to explore, the careers you still have the courage to pursue, the skills you still have time to develop, the relationships you still have the heart to makeâ€”like a pail of water you carry around in your head, which starts off feeling like an overwhelming burden but steadily draws down as you get older, splashing gallons over the side every time you take a step.”
		- “liberosisn. the desire to care less about things; to figure out a way to relax your grip on your life and hold it loosely and playfully, keeping it in the air like a volleyball, with quick and fleeting interventions, bouncing freely in the hands of trusted friends, always in play.”
		- “Maybe now is the time to stress-test your own assumptions about yourself, stripping away all the flourishes and ornaments that you don't really need, honing yourself down to the core of who you are.”
		- “There's so much that we keep in the back room; so much that other people never get to see. We only ever offer up a sample of who we are, of what we think people want us to be. And yet, how rarely do we stop to look inside, let our eyes adjust, and try to see what's really there, the worlds hidden away in the eyes of others.”
		- “routwashn. a moment of panic that you'll end up looking back on years of labor with little to show for it, that despite all the time you've spent gathering skills and connections and experiences, many of them will prove to have been worth almost nothing in the long run, redeemable for petty cash, a line on a rÃ©sumÃ©, a few compliments, or a handful of magic beans.”
		- “poggledadj. shocked upon looking twice at something you see every day and catching an obvious detail you'd never noticed beforeâ€”an old scar on your loved one's knee, a wall in your house that's apparently always been purple, or a prominent building that seemed to appear in your neighborhood overnightâ€”which makes you wonder how much else of your world you might be missing, when you're just barely there yourself.”
		- “Time has no inherent value. If it's a currency, it's a kind of fiat currency, in that you can't just cash it in for anything solid. Which means it's up to you to decide what it's worth trading for.”
		- “Everyone you meet is fighting some sort of battle. You can only wonder how many of your decisions were secretly preordained or precluded by forces outside your controlâ€”by history or prejudice, biology or dumb luck.”
		- “You may never make it to Egypt, but you've already built the pyramids inside your head. You might've only seen a few samurai movies and anime shows, but still assume you have a half-decent understanding of Japanese culture. In this way you build yourself a mental model of what lies beyond your horizon”
		- “Let the sun rise and fall. Let the waves pound themselves to mist, again and again. Your task is not to be flawless. Your task is to fly.”
		- “suenten. the state of being so familiar with someone that you can be in a room with them without thinking, without holding anything back, or without having to say a wordâ€”to the extent that you have to remind yourself that they're a different being entirely, that brushing hair away from their eyes won't help you see any better.”
		- “thraptadj. awed at the impact someone has had on your life, feeling intimidated by how profoundly they helped shape your identity, having served as a ghostwriter of a work that nevertheless only appears under your name.”
		- “strangest of all are those moments when you can almost transcend your singular nature, and feel yourself connecting with another human being.”
		- “halfwiseadj. suddenly aware that you're more than halfway through a vacation or semester or other positive experience, noticeably closer to the end than the beginning, as if someone had flipped your mental hourglass overnight, turning a rush of fun surprises into a trickle of last hurrahs.”
		- “grayshiftn. the tendency for future goals and benchmarks to feel huge when viewed in advance, only to fade into banality as soon as you've achieved themâ€”finally reaching the top of the ladder, only to notice it circling back around like a hamster wheel.”
		- “Why bother making long-term plans? What's the point of getting invested, when the sitcom will only get canceled, the house will break apart, the sand mandala swept into the trash? Why let yourself fall in love with someone when the best-case scenario is you'll end up losing them?”
		- “harmonoian. an itchy sense of dread when life feels just a hint too peacefulâ€”when everyone seems to get along suspiciously well, with an eerie stillness that makes you want to brace for the inevitable collapse, or burn it down yourself.”
		- “1202n. the tipping point when your brain becomes so overwhelmed with tasks you need to do, you feel too guilty to put anything off until later, prioritizing every little thing at the top of the list, leaving you immobilized.”
		- “flashovern. the moment a conversation becomes real and alive, when a spark of trust shorts out the delicate circuits you keep insulated under layers of irony, momentarily grounding the static emotional charge you've built up through decades of friction with the world.”
		- “Protectors all around you might be sheltering you from looming dangers, so you never have to lose sleep knowing how at risk you really were.”
		- “fygophobian. the fear that your connections with people will keep dwindling as you get older; that one by one, you'll all go flying off the merry-go-round in wildly different directions, sailing through various classes and jobs and interests, ultimately landing in far-flung neighborhoods where you'll hunker down with your families plus a handful of confidants you see a few times a year, perpetually reassuring each other, â€œWe should keep in touch.â€”
		- “emorriesn. vivid memories of a certain experience that you carry in your head for years until they're casually disputed by someone who remembers it very differently”
		- “hem-jawedadj. feeling trapped inside your own language, struggling to shake away the baggage weighing down certain words, unable to break out of its age-old structures and melodies, frustrated that the scattering of verbal pigments on its palette could never quite capture the colors in your head.”
		- “It's not hard to imagine how satisfying it would feel, cruising through the world on autopilot, along the optimum route at the optimum speed, hitting only the top-rated destinations. To have every question answered, every obstacle avoided, every risk insured in real time, with your odds of failure already calculated to the third decimal place, leaving you with little else to do but listen to a serene digital voice chime in with reminders and progress reports, muttering to yourself, I know, I know, I know.”
		- “So much of life is spent this way, in ordinary time. There's no grand struggle, no sacraments, no epiphanies. Just simple domesticity, captured in little images, here and there.”
		- “typificen. a caricature of yourself that went out of date years ago, though nobody around you seems to have noticed.”
		- “ It wasn't what you thought it would be, and yet you can still look back on all the things you've lost, and the opportunities that came and went, and feel a pang of gratitude that it happened at all. And now here you are, feeling a kind of joyful grief for your life, in all its blessings and mysteries and chances and changes.”
		- “dolorblindnessn. the frustration that you'll never be able to understand another person's pain, only ever searching their face for some faint evocation of it, then rifling through your own experiences for some slapdash comparison, wishing you could tell them truthfully, â€œI know exactly how you feel.â€”
		- “Each of us is only ever a work in progress; we all have weaknesses we're not sure how to fix. So why does it feel so surprising when we catch a glimpse of vulnerability in others? Why do we keep falling for the same old trick, when each of us spends so much time trying to get away with it ourselves?”
		- “It's often said that there's nothing to be gained in looking backward. But there are ways of thinking about the past that aren't just nostalgia or regret; a kind of questioning that can allow fresh context to trickle in over the years, slowly filling out the picture like an inkblot painting,”
		- “You'll never have friendships that occupy so much of your attention, spending hours together every day for months, which made even the slightest betrayal sting.”
		- “The owner of a little antiques shop in Wales leaves a note on the door saying, â€œBack in two minutes,â€ steps down the street to buy an apple and a banana, and is never seen again. The prime minister of Australia goes out for a swim before lunch on a Sunday, and soon enough a new election is held, and the search party is called off for good. An airliner full of passengers settles into its flight path and then disappears from the radar, as if it had never existed.”
		- “Such is life. Some days you wake up in Kansas, and some days in Oz. Sometimes the world feels pretty much stuck in place, and you've made your peace with that. Why waste time on silly pipe dreams, when there are socks to darn and pigs to feed? At other times, you look around and see how exciting the world can be, how flexible and arbitrary things are, how easy it might be to cast aside your old life and get to work building the one you really want.”
		- “endzonedn. the hollow feeling of having gotten exactly what you thought you wanted, only to learn that it didn't make you happy.In sports, the endzone is the final goal, the end of the lineâ€”but at a certain point you have to drop the ball.”
		- “manusian. the ambient feeling of being a human being; a baseline mood that everyone feels intensely every moment of their lives, but can never pin down because they have nothing else to compare it to.”
		- “It's hard not to glance at a stranger in a crowd and imagine the life you might have shared, if only things had been differentâ€”feeling a pang of missed connection as you carry on your separate ways,”
		- “momophobian. the fear of speaking off the cuff or from the heart; the terror of saying the wrong thing and having to watch someone's smile fade as they realize you're not who they thought you were.”
		- “fellchasern. a long-forgotten mistake from your past that could reappear at any time and rip your life apart, like a boomerang you tossed away years ago that's only just now looping back around, which you'd have no idea how to handle because you have no idea what it is.”

	- title:: [[The Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times]]
	  author:: Michelle Obama
		- “We knew so little and feared so much. Everything felt big. Everything felt consequential.Everything was big. Everything was consequential.It was hard not to feel overwhelmed.”
		- “There were plenty of subtle cues to remind us that we just barely belonged, that our presence was experimental, almost,conditional on our adhering to someone else's idea of good behavior.”
		- “When you're breaking new generational ground in your family,the first to leave your neighborhood, the first to go to college, the first to own a house or get any sort of toehold into stability,you travel with the pride and expectations of everyone who came before you, everyone who waved you toward the mountaintop, trusting that you'll get there even if they couldn't.”
		- “A Kitchen Table, in general, is never stagnant. Friends will come and go, taking on more or less importance as you move through different phases of life.”
		- “In life, it's hard to dream about what's not visible. When you look around and can't find any version of yourself out there in the wider world, when you scan the horizon and see nobody like you, you start to feel a broader loneliness, a sense of being mismatched to your own hopes, your own plans, your own strengths. You begin to wonder where,and how,you will ever belong.”
		- “But what he sees first, what he chooses to recognize, is a whole person, someone he's genuinely glad to see.”
		- “What does it mean to be comfortably afraid? For me, the idea is simple. It's about learning to deal wisely with fear, finding a way to let your nerves guide you rather than stop you. It's settling yourself in the presence of life's inevitable zombies and monsters so that you may contend with them more rationally, and trusting your own assessment of what's harmful and what's not. When you live this way, you are neither fully comfortable nor fully afraid. You accept that there's a middle zone and learn to operate inside of it, awake and aware, but not held back.”
		- “I can see now that this is exactly what big storms do: They breach our boundaries and burst our pipes. They tear down structures and flood our normal routes and pathways. They strip away the signposts and leave us in a changed landscape, changed ourselves, with no choice but to find a new way forward.”
		- “it's about doing what it takes to make your work count and your voice heard, despite the despites.”
		- “You were aware that if you made one mistake, or had one stumble, or there was one distracting crisis at home, you could be immediately and often permanently relegated to the group that got less.”
		- “We only hurt ourselves when we hide our realness away.”
		- “I learned not to hide who I was, but to own it.”
		- “It takes work to get yourself out of other people's mirrors. It takes practice to keep the right messages in your head.It's also helpful to acknowledge what makes this work so difficult.”
		- “defying your fear almost always involves defying a part of yourself. To me, this is a vital aspect of the decoding: You have to learn how to identify and then tame something within. You have to practice past those fears. The more you practice, the better you get at it. Each leap I've taken has only made the next leap easier.”
		- “WHEN YOU'RE BEGINNING something new, you can't always see where you're headed with it. You have to be okay with not knowing exactly how things will turn out.”
		- “Someday we will look back at this time we're now in. We will view it from a different historical perch, a set of future circumstances that we can hardly imagine now. I wonder what we will make of this time, what will feel recognizable and what will feel ancient. Which stories will get told? What changes will we have managed to make? What will we have forgotten and what will we have enshrined?”
		- “Anything you do,any action you take,can be seen as stepping over a line. ”
		- “it matters when we have opportunities to affirm a brave voice and diminish another person's isolation with words as simple as œme too.”
		- “When you know your own light, you are then better prepared to share it with another person. But you have to practice your way through all of it.”
		- “I came to realize that many of my classmates had grown up surrounded by people who looked and acted like them, their lives shaped by sameness, their comfort defined by it, too. Some had never had a peer who was Black or brown.”
		- “Gladness is nourishing. It is a gift. When someone is happy to see us, we get a little steadier on our feet. We have an easier time locking into our poise. And we carry that feeling forward.”
		- “Our hurts become our fears. Our fears become our limits.”
		- “when I hit a point of feeling or thinking or seeing too much, I've learned to make the choice to go toward the small.”
		- “Sometimes you have to clear the path in order to be able to walk on it yourself, as well as to ready it for others.”
		- “Many of us code-switch in order to get by, changing our behavior, appearance, or manner of speaking in order to better fit”
		- “Our vaults can leave us lonely, isolated from others, exacerbating the pain of invisibility. And that's a tough way to go. The amount we hold there, hidden out of sight and guarded by instinctive feelings of fear or shame, can contribute to a larger sense that we don't belong or don't matter”
		- “No one person, no one relationship, will fulfill your every need. Not every friend can offer you safety or support on every day. Not everyone can, or will, show up precisely when or how you need them to. And this is why it's good to always continue making room at your table, to keep yourself open to gathering more friends. You will never not need them, and you will never stop learning from them.”
		- “We adjust, hide, and compensate in order to manage our differentness in relation to the spaces we find ourselves in. We wear different masks,brave faces, really,for different situations, hoping to feel more safety or come closer to a sense of belonging, but still never feeling fully like ourselves.”
		- “For me, part of the beauty of "Heeey, Buddy!" is that it's not terribly ambitious. It doesn't really count as a pep talk. It requires no passion or eloquence, nor any sort of belief that the day ahead will be stellar, full of new opportunities and positive growth. It is merely a friendly hello”
		- “What does it mean to be comfortably afraid? For me, the idea is simple. It's about learning to deal wisely with fear, finding a way to let your nerves guide you rather than stop you. It's settling yourself in the presence of life's inevitable zombies and monsters so that you may contend with them more rationally, and trusting your own assessment of what's harmful and what's not. When you live this way, you are neither fully comfortable nor fully afraid. You accept that there's a middle zone and learn to operate inside of it, awake and aware, but not held back.”
		- “Barack and I had always tried to operate on the principles of hope and hard work, choosing to overlook the bad in favor of the good,”
		- “Going high is work,often hard, often tedious, often inconvenient, and often bruising. You will need to disregard the haters and the doubters.”
		- “At some point, however, life will inevitably complicate any dream, whether it's breaking into a certain professional field, performing on a big stage, or making meaningful social change. The limits come pretty quickly into view. Obstacles crop up. Naysayers emerge. Unfairness clutters the road. Practical concerns will often assert themselves. Money gets tight. Time grows short.”
		- “Which gaps did we try to close? Which did we simply acknowledge and let be? Who made the adjustments or tried to unlearn what they knew?”
		- “I could take a second to remind myself of what, inside the walls of my own home, inside the shelter of my friendships, I already knew to be true. My validation came from inside. And it helped to be able to carry that power into a new room.”
		- “They describe the self-consciousness that comes with feeling like you don't belong in the space you're in.”
		- “The fearful mind loves to show up at moments of peak stress, and with a clear agenda: It wants to veto everything.”
		- “I sometimes have to talk myself into bravery when I step out in public, or express my opinions, or take on something new.Most of what I'm describing here is abstract fear,fear of embarrassment or fear of rejection, worries that things will go wrong or someone will get hurt.”
		- “the hard problems and wearying thoughts will always be there, largely unfinished and mostly unfixed. The holes will always be big, the answers slow to come.So, in the meantime, claim a small victory. Understand that it's okay to be productive in a small way, to invest in endeavors that are adjacent to your big goals and larger dreams.”
		- “We have to be able to envision what's possible, summoning it from the unknown,whatever does not yet exist, the sort of world we hope to live in,in order to even begin to actualize a plan to get there.”
		- “Going high was a way to describe a choice we were trying to make to always try harder and think more.”
		- “There's no requirement to disclose every piece of private anguish you carry or every opinion in your head. Maybe, for a while, you just listen. Maybe you become a safe vessel for the stories of others, practicing what it feels like to receive another person's truth with kindness, remembering to protect the dignity of those who are bold enough to share in an honest way.”
		- “We retreat when hurt. We armor up when scared. We might attack when provoked or yield when ashamed.”
		- “Self-consciousness can do this. It can take away your footing and erase what you know to be true about yourself. It can leave you clumsy and unsure, disoriented about who and where you are. It's as if the world has held up a mirror at an unflattering angle, showing you your unrecognizability to others, all the ways in which you don't belong.”
		- “to consciously and intentionally take the first self-denigrating or negatively tinged thought that arrives in my head and slide it off to one side. Then I invite a second thought, a better and more tender one, something more intentional, more friendly to self. And I choose that as my launching point.”
		- “ She understood the importance of setting aside her fears and allowing me the power of my own competence, even as a kindergartner. And because she had faith in me, I had faith in me, too.”
		- “When it comes to wanting to make a difference in the world, I find that it can also be useful to break down those gigantic, all-or-nothing goals into their component parts.”
		- “When you start to get yourself somewhere, people who never saw you as different might now start to see you as different, or changed.”
		- “What are we sacrificing? Who does it serve? Are we compromising too much or denying our authentic selves in order to be accepted?”
		- “All around me, I see smart and creative folks who are working their way step-by-step into greater power and visibility, in many instances having figured out how to harness rather than hide whatever sets them apart. When we do this, we start to acknowledge all the contradictions and influences that make us unique. We normalize differentness.”
		- “What matters is that I can see and appreciate them, and they can see and appreciate me. My friends give me perspective. They help show me who I am.”
		- “once you allow the judgment of others inside, it gets distracting. This is a hallmark of self-consciousness, a shift from thinking about yourself to imagining how people are thinking about you. And it can also become a form of self-sabotage, because now suddenly, you, too, are perceiving your differentness first.”
		- “She was giving them a simple message of enoughness. She was validating their light, that unique bit of brightness inside each of them,literally showing them it was there and it belonged to them, a power they could carry for themselves.”
		- “For me, that one little church rehearsal turned out to be a rehearsal for all sorts of life moments ahead.”
		- “I was finding it harder to access my own hope or to feel like I could make an actual difference.”
		- “Rage spreads easily, along with hurt, disappointment, and panic. ”
		- “You have to begin playing both offense and defense at the same time, pushing yourself forward while also doubling back to guard your resources, advancing toward your goals without fully draining your strength.”
		- “In the end, the child you have will grow into the person they're meant to be. They will learn life their own way. You will control some but definitely not all of how it goes for them.”
		- “The people who deliver these messages become almost impossible to forget. They haunt us like ghosts. How many of us remain in a one-way dialogue with someone who demeaned or diminished us even decades ago?”
		- “Nearly everyone on earth experiences this sort of feeling at some point,that prickling awareness that you're somehow not suited to your environment, that you're being viewed as a trespasser.”
		- “The unknown is where possibility glitters.”
		- “ Who doesn't feel a jolt when walking into a room full of strangers or taking a public stance on something important? These are moments of distinct discomfort, foisted upon us routinely by life. But they can be thrilling, too.Why? Because we don't know what lies on the other side of that initial experience. And the journey to get there might just be transformative.”
		- “This is the power of small, where the intermediate steps matter, where it can be relieving to engage in what's immediately in front of you, and where a start can more readily lead to a finish.This is how we move from It's all too much back in the direction of I've got this.”
		- “I am glad that we work side by side. I'm glad for who you are. And I'm glad for myself, too.”
		- “We need to keep trying to go high. We must commit and recommit ourselves to the idea. Operating with integrity matters. It will matter forever. It is a tool.”
		- “Read books by people whose perspective is different from yours, listen to voices you haven't heard before, look for narratives that are new to you. In them and with them, you might end up finding more room for yourself.”
		- “I was looking at my truest love and my life's greatest disrupter.”
		- “He made a point of not holding on to pain or embarrassment, knowing that it wasn't likely to serve him, recognizing that there was a certain power in being able to shake things off, in letting certain moments go.”
		- “Do I belong?What do others think of me?How am I seen?”
		- “Go forth with a spoonful of fear and return with a wagonful of competence.”
		- “we need to remember to keep laying the small alongside the big. One is a good companion for the other. Small endeavors help to guard our happiness, to keep it from getting consumed by all that's big”
		- “The thick-skin part means learning what to do with your rage and your hurt, where to put it, how to convert it into actual power. It means picking a destination and understanding it will take some time to get there.”
		- “We are whole and uncontainable people with whole and uncontainable lives. Our messes sometimes travel with us to work. Our vulnerabilities surface, our worries spill over. Our personalities, not to mention those of others around us, aren't so easily tamped into a mold.”
		- “We are all guests at one another's tables, sharing the privilege of intimacy and honesty.”
		- “These messages of not-belonging create wounds, and the wounds don't easily go away.”
		- “In school, in jobs, and even inside of families and relationships, we are routinely asked to prove our worth, conditioned to believe we must pass a series of tests in order to win approval or advance ourselves.”
		- “In clinging only to what you know, you are making your world small. You are robbing yourself of chances to grow.”
		- “I had always presumed that my head was fully in charge of everything, including telling my hands what to do. It hadn't really ever occurred to me to let things flow the opposite way. But that's what knitting did. It reversed the flow. It buckled my churning brain into the back seat and allowed my hands to drive the car for a while. It detoured me away from my anxiety, just enough to provide some relief.”
		- “We've become adept at making noise and congratulating one another for it, but sometimes we forget to do the work.”
		- “The challenge in leading a big life becomes trying to find ways to protect your dreams and your drive, to remain tough without being overly guarded, to stay nimble and open to growth, allowing others to see you for who you are. It's about learning how to shelter your flame without hiding its light.”
		- “How do we build places where gladness lives,for ourselves and for others, and most especially for children,and to which we will always want to return?”
		- “My life became a kind of reply: Your limits aren't mine. To this day, she gets no gratitude from me, but I was able, in response to her indifference, to discover something in myself, a certain resolve.”
		- “The attention given to my height brought about a new self-consciousness in me, a slight sense of otherness.”
		- “you don't take the risk, if you don't ride out a few jolts, you are taking away your opportunities to transform.”
		- “Who doesn't worry about loss, or harm, or failure? We are all constantly processing our fears, attempting to sort out actual emergencies from manufactured ones.”
		- “I know that's part of the job of being a parent,to project an extra smidge of certainty even as your own knees are buckling a little bit beneath you”
		- “A motto stays hollow if we only repeat it and put it on products we can sell on Etsy. We need to embody it, pour ourselves into it,pour our frustration and hurt into it, even.”
		- “ My power lay in whatever I could manage to do with that hurt and rage, where I could take it, what sort of destination I chose for it.”
		- “when the wholeness of your story adds to the wholeness of mine. I see a little of you. You see a little of me. We can't know all of it, but we're better off as familiars.”
		- “life happens in seasons. Your fulfillment,in love, family, and career,rarely happens all at once. In a strong partnership, both people will take their turns at compromise, building that shared sense of home together, there in the in-between.”
		- “He didn't focus on who he wasn't or what he didn't have. Instead, he measured his value by who he was and what he had”
		- “You start carrying the load of your label, whatever that label may be. Your differentness attaches to you like a flag.All this creates an extra burden, extra distraction. It adds another layer of required thinking to situations that for some might be casual, but for you now take energy.”
		- “I became even more intimately acquainted with my fearful mind, that ruthless, naysaying part of me that was sure nothing ever would,or could,work out. Over and over and over again, I had to coach myself not to listen to it. ”
		- “When we allow ourselves to celebrate tiny victories as important and meaningful, we start to understand the incremental nature of change”
		- “It means that you have to be judicious with your energy and clear in your convictions. You push ahead in some instances and pull back in others, giving yourself opportunities to rest and restore.”
		- “Walk around wearing too much of it, being too defensive, too prepared for combat, and it'll slow you down”
		- “Our differences are treasures and they're also tools. They are useful, valid, worthy, and important to share. Recognizing this, not only in ourselves but in the people around us, we begin to rewrite more and more stories of not-mattering”
		- “Your table needs to be deliberately built, deliberately populated, and deliberately tended to.”
		- “Regardless of where we'd arrived from, we're just visitors passing through.”
		- “But the thing is, when someone does light up for us, we remember it. The feeling lands.”
		- “Am I afraid because I'm in actual danger, or is it simply because I'm staring newness in the face?”
		- “It was from this quiet vantage point that I was able to see past my grief and frustration and locate my lost conviction”
		- “Are we reacting or are we responding? It's worth thinking about sometimes. It's a question I ask myself before I post anything on social media or make any sort of public comment.”
		- “As a woman of color, she recognized a certain feeling, something we both shared, which is the ongoing challenge of trying to feel comfortable in places in which you are a minority.”
		- “You may hike all the way up to whatever mountaintop it is you're hoping to reach,a job, a school, an opportunity,nobly carrying the hopes and expectations of your loved ones, batting away messages of shame and otherness like a superhero as you go. And when the climb finally ends and you arrive, exhausted and sweating, to that high place with a pretty view that you've long dreamed about, there's one thing you're almost always guaranteed to encounter, and that's an air-conditioned luxury tour bus and a group of people who did none of the work, having been driven straight up an access road, their picnic blankets already laid out, their party well under way.It's a demoralizing feeling. I've seen it and I've felt it myself.”
		- “Discomfort is a teacher. Lack of reward is a teacher. Dealing with these things gives us practice at life, helping us figure out who we are when we're a little pushed. When that tool is missing from your toolbox, it gets harder to navigate the adult world and the intricate dance of friendship.”
		- “I found myself grasping for heroes, anyone who even remotely resembled me, anyone who could light the path forward and show me what was possible”
		- “Any time I hear the patter of negativity and self-criticism starting to get loud in my brain, when my doubts begin to build, I try to pause for a moment and call it as I see it.”
		- “The choices we make when feeling afraid, I believe, often determine the larger outcomes in our lives.”
		- “Nothing felt even remotely like enough.”
		- “Your love and sturdiness are immeasurable and have kept me grounded and hopeful during these strange and uncertain times. Thank you for always getting me through.”
		- “Emotions are not plans. They don't solve problems or right any wrongs. You can feel them,you will feel them, inevitably,but be careful about letting them guide you. Rage can be a dirty windshield. Hurt is like a broken steering wheel. Disappointment will only ride, sulking and unhelpful, in the back seat.”
		- “For me, preparedness is part of the armor I wear. I plan, rehearse, and do my homework ahead of anything that feels even remotely like a test. This helps me to operate with more calm under stressful circumstances, knowing I will most often, regardless of what happens, find some pathway through. Being organized and prepared helps keep the floor feeling more solid beneath my feet.”
		- “And you will need to be doing it with someone who is equally able and willing to create the same latitude and show the same forbearance toward you,to love you despite all the baggage you show up with, despite what you look like and how you behave when you are at your absolute worst.”
		- “How you view yourself becomes everything. It's your foundation, the starting point for changing the world around you. I learned that from him. My father's visibility helped me to find my own.”
		- “ It surfaced as a kind of ease,and not the ease that comes from privilege or wealth, but from something different. It was ease despite struggle. Ease despite uncertainty. It was ease from within.It made him noticeable, visible in all the right ways.”
		- “Doubt comes from within. Your fearful mind is almost always trying to seize the steering wheel and change your course. Its whole function is to rehearse catastrophe, scare you out of opportunity, and throw rocks at your dreams.”
		- “If I begin to feel out of sync, if I'm feeling unsupported or overwhelmed, I try to take stock of what my garden holds, what I've planted and what I still need to mix in: What's feeding my soil? What's helping to block the weeds? Am I cultivating both the small and the tall?”
		- “I embraced the power of small by narrowing my focus, choosing to work on a few key issues that were meaningful to me as I stayed dedicated to my family. And I tried to be kind to myself, to both protect and share my light while drawing from the boundless light offered by others”
		- “if we must continuously contort, adjust, hide, and guard ourselves at work,we risk losing opportunities to be seen as our best and truest selves, as expressive, fruitful, and full of ideas.”
		- “It matters when we feel safe enough to show ourselves without shame and find ways to speak openly of the experiences that made us into the people we are.”
		- “you should also invest in that curiosity,setting aside time and energy for your friendship to grow and deepen, privileging it ahead of the things that will pile up and demand your attention in ways that friendship seldom does.”
		- “There's something unnerving about moving through a place and not seeing people who look like you anywhere.”
		- “When we are given a kind start, when another person greets us with unfettered gladness or trusts our ability to succeed, it can have a lasting, lifting sort of effect.”
		- “ Had the uncertainties made us anxious? Did the newness create discomfort? Sure, many times. And yet hadn't we proven ourselves more competent, more adaptable each step of the way?”
		- “sometimes the big stuff becomes easier to handle when you deliberately put something small alongside it.”
		- “I've learned that my initial thoughts are rarely all that valuable; they're just the starting point from which we move forward.”

	  author:: Natasha Lunn
		- “The problem is not being alone. It’s being alone when you have a story in your head about human beings, and the proper place of companionship within our story. Instead of going out to learn dancing simply to avoid Saturday-night agony, you could change the story in your head about what being alone means. Because if being in your own company is fine on a Monday and a tragedy on a Saturday, the problem is not the objective fact of being alone, it’s the story you’re telling yourself.”
		- “By encouraging people to say their negative thoughts out loud it reassures them they are not an awful person. Often someone feels those things, not because of something bad they’ve done, but due to a free-floating shame that exists because they learnt as a child to believe they were bad.”
		- “According to Dr Poe, who used to teach a course on love at New York University, ‘People think, if I’m matching the other person then we’re a match, but that makes them more insecure because they’re not being themselves.”
		- “Because how can we work out how to find love without asking what that word really means? ”
		- “The best frame of mind to be in – for anything you want – is an ability to walk away from it, were it not to come right.”
		- “Acknowledging your brokenness, pain and insufficiency is a rather romantic thing to do. Actually, an overemphatic self-admiration cuts you off from other people, whereas an engagement with your own vulnerability is key to building a bond. When it comes to self-love it’s not so much about loving yourself, but accepting that all human beings have their less impressive sides, and so your less impressive sides don’t cut you off from the possibility of having a good relationship.”
		- “One way of looking at the risk of losing yourself is through the prism of self-love or self-hatred, but another is asking, how much fidelity are you going to bring to being certain of your own feelings? And how many of your feelings are going to be overruled by stories that come in from the outside?”
		- “One of the best models of love is how parents love their children. Parents really love their children. At the same time, sometimes they don’t like them – they get bored of them, they think they’re awful, they want a break from them. And all those things go on in the love that an adult might have for another, too: sometimes we’re fed up and aware of somebody’s glaring faults, but still very much on their side. They annoy us and we still love them.”
		- “You can’t tell where somebody else is in their life. They might just not fancy you, which is deeply unfortunate, but something to be accepted, not fought over, like bad weather.”
		- “No one really wants to be idealized – we want to be seen and accepted and forgiven, and to know that we can be ourselves in our less edifying moments.”
		- “Could we imagine the many different ways there are to live a life? Could we imagine all the potential sorrows and joys in all those different stories? Perhaps, if we could, we would see that there are no ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ stories after all – just the lives in front of us, full of possibilities.”
		- “Giving up that control is about having faith that things happened as they’re meant to, and if a plan doesn’t go accordingly that’s because there’s something else waiting for you – you just don’t know what it is yet.”
		- “As I grew older, I learnt that the expectation that someone will save you from who you are, or from what you have or don’t have, is a fallacy. Expecting someone to fill in a hole that’s within you? That’s expecting too much of any one person. That’s not your friend’s job or your partner’s job. That’s your job.”
		- “the minute someone pities you, you think, am I not living the way I’m meant to? We spend our whole lives trying to meet targets set by someone else. We lose sight of who we are, because we’re so busy chasing external things.”
		- “Part of trying to figure out what you really want from life is ensuring you’re selective about who you surround yourself with, so now I largely refuse to go to places where I know I’ll be interrogated about not being married, because there’s no love or concern there. It’s just nosiness.”
		- “meaning in life comes from the kindness and compassion you show to others, and also from a deep, peaceful acceptance that allows you to look disaster and joy in the eye with the same kind of level-headedness.”
		- “being strong doesn’t mean you don’t need people. We’re not born to be alone. We need community, however we choose to find it: with a partner, with friends, with family.”
		- “when we stop relying on one person to make us happy, we not only find more confidence to question a relationship that isn’t working; we live a more varied and interesting life”
		- “Nobody is right for anyone. Actually, what makes somebody right is commitment.”
		- “Sometimes you want to become the other person’s fantasy, so you don’t lose them. You can be knocked out of shape a bit, and that’s different from mutual impact. That’s adaption, which is bad because you’re morphing out of shape to please the other. Whereas when you allow mutual impact, you’re not putting on an act to please the other – you allow impact because it’s the flow of dialogue, and hopefully you’re both doing it.”
		- “You’re not rigid and unchanging; you are moved by each other. It’s like two stones rubbing together until suddenly they fit. ”
		- “Meeting someone often happens in a place where you get used to being around them. You like or love someone when you like or love yourself when you’re with them – and that takes a long time to know. You have to let them in.”
		- “It’s about finding someone you can be ‘you’ around without performing, without being the party person or the successful I’m-in-control-of-everything person. Someone you can experiment with being vulnerable in front of and accepted by. ”
		- “They might think, if you knew the real me, you wouldn’t love me, because they felt the real ‘me’ wasn’t loved.”
		- “Because when you like who you are when you are with another person, you realize how important it is to be around people who make you feel that way. They reflect your goodness back to you, and you know you’ve got it.”
		- “part of falling in love is letting another person have an impact on you”
		- “Because being yourself in a relationship is a risk. It means showing someone the real bits of who you are – the spots beneath the make-up; the self-doubt beneath the cynicism – and finding the courage to say, ‘This is me. Take it or leave it,’ and to really mean it.”
		- “When you want to change to keep a partner interested, that’s ‘adaption’, which is bad because you’re bending your identity to please another. Whereas when you change alongside another person, that’s ‘mutual impact’, because you’re not putting on an act to please anyone. Instead, you’re growing, individually and together.”
		- “It’s easy to see now how short-sighted my approach to this portion of life was. How focused I was on receiving love, instead of giving it; on waiting for it, instead of building it. ”
		- “I think our job – maybe even our “duty” – is to – To bear the burden of the mystery with as much grace as we can."
		- “There will always be temptations to hide from ourselves. The important thing is to notice them, to resist them, and to keep finding ways to be honest in our relationships. ”
		- “ I wondered if the ugliest shade of unhappiness comes, not directly from what you lack, but from wanting a different life to the one you’re living.”
		- “I needed to ask, what would a better way of seeing look like? And how do you move forward when uncertainty tempts you towards cynicism?”
		- “The important thing, she explained, was not to make the ‘right’ or ‘best’ decision, but ‘to closely bind yourself to whatever you’re living’. She said, ‘You make your life meaningful by applying meaning to it – it’s not just inevitably meaningful as a result of the choices you’ve made.”
		- “When we feel lonely, we’re unhappy and long to escape this emotional pain. Solitude, by contrast, is a state of peaceful aloneness … it is an opportunity for self-reflection and a chance to connect to ourselves without distraction or disturbance.”
		- “Maybe not having something you want wakes you up to another kind of romance. And when life forces you to live in the intensity of the unknown, between two possible futures, it’s also a chance to develop the inner resources and love that will serve you well in the years ahead.”
		- “Maybe, then, this is how you try to bear the burden of the mystery with grace: by finding humility where you once saw self-pity, and opportunity where you once saw absence. By saying, ‘Even if I don’t get what I want, I have a good life,’ then paying closer attention to the small details that make that life beautiful. ”
		- “we continued to find ways to make our lives overlap.”
		- “If I felt then that the men I dated saw me only as a faint pencil sketch of a person, Marisa, by contrast, didn’t just see me clearly but brought out all the colours. When you spend time around a friend who makes you feel this way, you’re left with a lingering sense of peace.”
		- “ My childhood was difficult, and because of that I fear that people I get close to might leave.”
		- “They taught me love could be consistent and solid and steady, that it could make me feel safe.”
		- “When we end a phone call, I don’t say, ‘Love you, bye,’ I say, ‘I love you.’ When we’re apart, I tell them how much I miss them, and when we’re together, how beautiful they look. ”
		- “I’ve woven a big part of my identity through looking after people, and I know that part of love in friendship is asking for your needs to be met too.”
		- “They point out my successes when sometimes I can’t see them. They show me the good parts of who I am when I don’t like myself.”
		- “She told a reader looking for romantic love, ‘You have to put on an artist’s mindset and get creative and paint a portrait of a life alone that’s breathtaking.”
		- “How can we love someone in a way that brings out the best in them? How can we commit, not only to the whole of who they are today, but to who they could be in the future?”
		- “You make a pact to build a life with someone without knowing what that life will look like. Without knowing who will get sick or who will lose their job, whose sex drive will change or whose in-laws might need regular care. This is what we do when we begin a relationship: we commit to something unknowable.”
		- “the best definition of happiness is the ability to approach your life as this gorgeous, unfolding work of art that’s always changing, and never quite what you expect it to be, and then seeing that it’s more beautiful than anything that’s supposedly perfect and pristine”
		- “to be in love is to recognize meaning in small, mundane moments”
		- “What would the best possible version of my life look like without the thing I am longing for?”
		- “But the truth is that being in love, or loving someone and being really happy, includes a lot of self-possessed behaviour. It requires you to feel your way towards what you want, make your own decisions, and save yourself.”
		- “used to wish I knew you can only feel love when you feel worthy of love, and that includes doing things that make you feel good, like developing a career and becoming independent and having friends. But actually, I think what’s more important is understanding your desires and your urges and your complexity, rejecting dominant narratives about how weak and needy and bad and broken you are, and defining for yourself what you are instead.”
		- “Just as I had learnt that a beautiful life contains joy and suffering, the people we love have amazing and frustrating layers”
		- “She also reminded me that, as much as love involves consciousness, part of it requires us to close our eyes and jump without a plan. And the fact that we took that leap, without knowing that everything would work out? Perhaps that act of faith, of hope, might carry us through tougher times, when we look back and marvel at it, and think, how little we knew, how easily we could have found a reason not to jump. Perhaps we will feel grateful for this naive decision, which allowed us to make a hundred more”
		- “our experiences are bridges not ravines.”
		- “Some days I feel I’ve got nothing, some days I wake up and feel I’ve got everything. Some days I can let go of the losses, some days I feel they’re crowding in on me, and they become stratas within the rock that I think I’ll never dig through.”
		- “Why did we ever think that loss wasn’t part of what it is to be a human being? Why does it come as such a shock to us?”
		- “there are often lessons hiding in those moments where we don’t get what we want in life”
		- “We’re creatures of wanting, but also of consciousness. So the way that we can push back on longing is to pay attention to what we have.”
		- “She can’t feel joy without feeling that loss.”
		- “A lot of us have those moments of pointing to other people and saying, ‘They got this, and I didn’t.’ But none of that matters in the end, because I know I’ve been lucky to have my life as it’s unfolded. Once I let go of resentment, I was able to see that. ”
		- “somewhere along the way I lost the idea that I could go with other people too. I felt marooned by travelling alone, like I was in an orbit and I couldn’t come back to Earth. I think we have to find a way to balance the messaging about being independent and self-reliant with the human desire to be connected, to love and be loved.”
		- “who are all the people who add joy to our lives? Whose voice on the other end of the phone reminds us to have faith? Whose company reminds us of our best qualities when we’ve forgotten them? Who makes us laugh when we’re on the edge of tears? And then: how can we hold on to these people?”
		- “it means being brave enough to hope for what you want, but wise enough to know that life is not one love story, but many.”
		- “ It shouldn’t take a story of loss to make me appreciate a Tuesday morning phone call with my mum”
		- “Instead of waiting for love, I could choose it. I could notice and listen and pay better attention to the people already in my life.”
		- “The story of human intimacy is one of constantly allowing ourselves to see those we love most deeply in a new, more fractured light. Look hard. Risk that.”
		- “The search for any kind of love, I now believe, is a continual process of looking in and out. Looking inwards to understand yourself, to be curious about your needs and desires and gifts and flaws, to develop generosity and self-compassion. Then looking outwards to use the power those things give you to love other people, and the life you are living too. What I had learnt is that you don’t really find love at all; you create it,”
		- “I am more interested in the love that deepens over time.
		- Everybody’s relationship to love is different. Sometimes it is great; sometimes it isn’t. New love is always exciting, but what happens after the newness of a relationship fades or dims is more beautiful to me. It’s something that grows, where there is patience and humour, where you can be furious with someone and still love them”
		- “Because a relationship isn’t a course you can study for and then complete. Instead, it is a decision you make every day to build something meaningful with another person.”
		- “Love often goes wrong because of a lack of self-reflection and understanding.’ In order to be a good partner, she suggested, you have to understand what you need and fear, the insecurities that disguise themselves in other emotions.”
		- “my life was a picture and my loss was the frame; everything I did hung in the context of what I didn’t have.”
		- “What I did learn is not to try to silence the sadness, but to focus more on living. Because love is rarely a pristine story”
		- “To some extent, we each must carry our own sadness and I was the only person who could forgive my body and learn to be at peace inside it.”
		- “The fleeting parts are tiny pockets of time like these, which we must do our best to pay attention to.”
		- “We have to rebuild the relationships we value again and again, even when our hearts or egos are wounded”
		- “Ad Astra (To the Stars). When I looked it up, I found it can be part of a phrase meaning ‘to the stars through hardships’,”
		- “we need different people in our life to see different parts of who we are. ”
		- “you can absolutely find newness in an older relationship, too, if you’re open to it”
		- “People often say, ‘Oh, love takes a lot of work,’ but I’ve found it’s an effort that doesn’t feel like work – it’s just maintenance. What I love, and what has been unexpected, is that in a good relationship loving someone can be easy.”
		- “Believing that I deserve love is a work in progress for me. I try to believe it every day, and on the days when I don’t, I try not to be too hard on myself. I’m able to do that because I know our love is steady. I know my partner is going to love me, whether I believe I deserve it or not.”
		- “although you have to work at a relationship, you shouldn’t have to work at convincing someone to love you. Either they do or they don’t”
		- “I think the reason people view older love as safe companionship is because we are scared to look honestly at its frailty. If we were to admit how fragile it is, it would be terrifying, because we have leveraged so much of our lives into it. Whereas with a new love, you’re aware of every fracture and place that it could go wrong, but the stakes aren’t as high yet.”
		- “When I feel that frailty, there’s a scary part to it that ensures I don’t take love for granted”
		- “So when you’re choosing a partner what you’re really choosing is how a person weathers change. You’re choosing how you weather change with and alongside them.”
		- “Like you, your partner is always work in progress. As someone who loves them, your job is to keep knowing them, to keep being curious.”
		- “once you’ve got close to somebody, they can much more easily push your buttons than a stranger can, and vice versa”
		- “ They hold worlds and worlds inside of them that are inaccessible to you at certain points but can be accessed at others. And that’s tremendously gratifying.”
		- “It’s about getting into the habit of thinking, I can feel myself getting angry. It’s fine to have this feeling, and it’s important, because it’s telling me something. But what should I do with the feeling”
		- “a balance between you where your lives are intertwined, but they’re not so intertwined that you lose your own identity and the elements that brought you together in the first place”
		- “if you lose a sense of yourself as an individual it can damage a relationship, but if you can’t accept that your needs and wants are not the only story, then it will be difficult to understand your partner’s perspective. ”
		- “The truth is, there are going to be times when you don’t feel ‘in love’ with your partner, or when you wonder if someone else might make you happier. It’s useful to know and accept that, instead of thinking it means there is something wrong.”
		- “If you tell me, ‘I care about my partner,’ then my second question is, ‘How do you show it?’ The fact that you feel it isn’t enough. What do you do to let the other person know and yourself that that’s the case?”
		- “The openness of your relationship depends on the openness of your conversations.”
		- “An adult relationship is one in which people negotiate disclosure, intimacy, openness, what is together, what is apart.”
		- “sometimes old friendships evolve like plants whose roots outgrow their pots: they are still alive, still growing, but they need more space to survive. More room to allow new people and experiences in too.”
		- “The friend who holds your hand and says the wrong thing is made of dearer stuff than the one who stays away.”
		- “To sustain friendships – old and new – I think we have to learn when to accept distance, and when to fight to repair it.”
		- “There are years when, if we pull on it too much, tug for more of the thread than the other person is able to give at that point in their life, then it will become tight and strained and tense. It might even snap. But if we can loosen our grip a little, let it slacken in the middle, it will give both friends space to move closer and further apart”
		- “Inevitably, there are some friendships that do slip away completely. In others, there might be months or years when we have to give each other space to disappear; and maybe that is a form of love too.”
		- “It’s much harder to hold our nerve, to trust in the love between us, to accept the gaps in our knowledge of each other creeping in and then continue to make the effort anyway. But when we do, the greatest gift: to find that it’s still there, love, shining between us, despite everything.”
		- “No meaningful relationship can be consistently easy. Even the closest friends will neglect or misinterpret each other, say the wrong thing, feel rejected by change when different life stages pull them apart. The question, then, is not how to avoid these painful missteps, but how to keep trying to tell the truth to each other, regardless.”
		- “Love, whether in friendship or romantic relationships, goes wrong when we forget to tell people who we are and forget to ask who they are.”
		- “the envy you project on to others is a sign of what you want but can’t get for yourself”
		- “Our desires have become so hidden and forbidden that we’re not even aware of them on a conscious level.”
		- “ If I could ask myself, ‘What is it that she has that I’m not able to enact for myself?’ then instead of feeling stranded and envious, maybe I could tell you I’m feeling inadequate in X, Y and Z departments, and I could get help. That’s difficult to do. It’s also useful, because there are always going to be times when you’re out of sync with friends, and that’s going to hurt if you have been in sync for great periods of your life.”
		- “You learn to understand that one friend’s problem doesn’t take precedence; they can both coexist as difficult situations.”
		- “It’s about acknowledging that our experiences in the world are different from each other’s, rather than only seeking to find similarities.”
		- “But it also means that, as we change, our friends won’t necessarily understand that we are not who we were last month, last year, or a decade ago. And we can’t expect them to. It is up to us to tell our friends who we are, and to be curious about who they are today too.”
		- “Saying, ‘I’m proud you are achieving so much in your career, but sometimes that reminds me I’m struggling with mine.’ Or, ‘It’s amazing to see you content in your relationship, but often I feel there’s no room in your life for me any more.’ Or, in my case, ‘I love seeing pictures of your baby, but they also remind me how sad I am about not being pregnant.”
		- “Once we free ourselves from asking who we feel most sorry for, or who has made the best choice, and just allow those pains to coexist? I think that is the key to intimacy in your friendships.”
		- “I’ve sunk into the safe, precious solidness of their love for me, and I know that, although it will take work, it is also a love that will be there for ever. True friendship is about taking it easy on each other, knowing that life has tides that take you to various places, and that you’ll find a way back to each other at different points.”
		- “We were all different people. But the love had remained.”
		- “we have to find a way to truthfully share our vulnerability, even when that feels like a risk. This is how we continue to reach each other. And, perhaps, it is only once we trust in the sturdiness of our friendships that we can fully appreciate the richness of their layers. The lives that change. The love that remains. How it continues to hold us.”
		- “I probably put pressure on them to remain a certain version of themselves, and for our friendship to remain in a certain dynamic, because, for me, something being constant meant that it was successful. ”
		- “I had learnt, we cannot expect another person to shoulder all of our needs. We can cry on them. We can share our lives and fears and underwear with them. But in order to experience the joy of these relationships, we have to make space for each other’s separateness.”
		- “What pieces of ourselves could – and should – we protect, and which would we need to give up?”
		- “this idea that every time you look at your child as they’re growing, you see the same person through different stages of their life”
		- “You can fully witness each other changing. And there’s something reassuring about the fact that, no matter how distant you might have become from yourself, no matter how much your relationship or your career has changed you, you can still connect with a person who knew you when you were a teenager. An old friendship is one of those things that helps you remember who you are in the world, and that’s so valuable.”
		- “Priya made me feel like I had a warrior on my side. I needed someone who would understand me and be in my corner without trying to fix things”
		- “we draw strength from being in each other’s orbit. When we spend time in each other’s company, our batteries have been filled up a little, and when we’re apart, there’s this little part of us that’s missing.”
		- “This is what I now believe is part of the work of sustaining love: first, to create and make space for moments like these. And then? To notice them. To feel their fragility and their preciousness and their newness, even when they seem familiar.”
		- “It is easy to notice someone when they are not there, when their absence makes you crave their return.”
		- “the love is in the act itself: the noticing, the forgiving, the reflecting, the trying.”
		- “In the joyful ones, will we overlook the beauty, or will we be consciously present? And in the painful ones, will we decide it’s easier to shut the conversation down than to dig for the uncomfortable truths? Or will we find a way back to a loving place?”
		- “It is a constant reminder that intention is not enough, and that even if our friends and family and partners know that we love them, sometimes they deserve a little evidence.”
		- “In loving them, it is our privilege to see and bring out all the different worlds and colours and depths within them, just as they have the potential to do the same for us in return. This reciprocity is at the heart of love – a balance of giving and receiving, of seeing and being seen, of asking and answering, of thinking always as ‘I’ and ‘we”
		- “the sadness chooses its own timeline – you lose a future in a moment, and then you are left to mourn it at a pace you can’t control”
		- “you just lie there, not wanting to get out of bed, not wanting to face the day that contains your loss.”
		- “How do you mourn the loss of a future you never really had?”
		- “I see there are three parts to the deeper story of my sadness: the loss itself, the loneliness that accompanied it, and the shame – a feeling that I should have moved on by now.”
		- “That’s why we should honour the heartbreaks that matter deeply to us, however insignificant we fear they might seem to anyone else.”
		- “I had to accept my miscarriage was meaningful to me, but I also had to let go of the future I’d planned for in order to live fully in the life that I am lucky to have. The real life that’s happening now, here, today. ”
		- “In some of those moments, the relationship between love and loss seemed simple: you lost the love, then you were left with the grief. One was the price for the other.”
		- “love and loss were not separate, consecutive stages, but two sides of the same coin. Grief did not follow or replace love – each thing existed inside the other. And loss was not a faraway thing, but a part of every loving, fading moment.”
		- “it would not be possible to explore love without confronting loss too”
		- “we risk every time we choose to love someone: not just that they might outlive us, or we them, but that they might break the heart we place in their hands.”
		- “loss is not a mountain you climb up and come down the other side of. You never entirely get over it, but you do rise to the challenge, until eventually you live with the loss and it becomes part of you.”
		- “To find a way through losses like those, you do have to continue to cherish what is good in life: the snowdrops that you see in winter, the cake you bake with your children, the moment when you laugh with a friend.”
		- “I think people have a great capacity to fall in love again, even after immense loss.”
		- “you can’t live your life fearing what lies around the corner.”
		- “getting over a loss was an impossible goal. Instead, we learn to live with our griefs inside us, and to let them transform us, until they reveal our resilience.”
		- “I learnt how to love, in my best form, through Ronan. I wouldn’t have been able to love in this way if I hadn’t been broken open by the experience of loving and losing him.”
		- “But she does invite us to ask: what will we do with the lot life has given us, however unfair it might seem?”
		- “Life is beautiful and we don’t have time to realize it. We let silly and petty things rule us and lead us into criticism. We find fault with life because we are tired and grumpy, instead of relishing the fact that we are with other people who are healthy, who love us and want to be with us.”
		- “you grow to accept that, in the present, things are the way they are, and you better start enjoying living, not destroy yourself by thinking about things that might or might not happen.”
		- “Stephen invited me to think about the ‘everydayness of loss’: the tender melancholy that comes with letting go of significant places – schools, universities, jobs – as we seek out new adventures. Or the loss of a youth we leave behind to build an adult future. Rather than something we experience a handful of times, I learnt that loss is part of every day, and part of love too. ”
		- “Love gives everything meaning but is too easily thrown away.”
		- “To my way of thinking, life is a series of necessary losses. From the very start, there is loss.”
		- “Life requires of us that we let go of places, things, people that we love, to make room for new life, new love. Development demands loss – it’s unbearable, we resist it, but if we are to grow, we must endure this pain.”
		- “We help children by being with them in their grief; standing with them in their experience of loss.”
		- “The capacity to love – the opposite of narcissism – is the capacity to see other people, their lives and feelings, as real.”
		- “So my crippling is a daily living sculpture of certain truths; we receive and we lose, and we must try to achieve gratitude; and with that gratitude to embrace with whole hearts whatever of life that remains after the losses.”
		- “what we can control, as Ariel told me, is whether we choose to prioritize love, even in the face of a loss as seismic as the one she had lived through. ”
		- “Grief is isolating. You’re in a tunnel of all-encompassing pain. Everybody else is walking through the world and you are living in an alternate reality within that world”
		- “At first you live in grief, then it lives in you.”
		- “There will always be times when resilience or love is harder to find because you are drained and scared. Some days it was a victory to be able to wheel her to the loo, or to swing her legs out of the bed. ”
		- “We need to ask: how would I want to die? Then talk about it with family or write it down.”
		- “We might avoid talking about death because we can’t bear to think about losing the people we love, when actually, not talking about it is one of the reasons we can take them for granted every day.”
		- “I’d dwelt on these holes an absence would leave. I hadn’t given any thought to the positive impact we have on each other, all the enduring traces of goodness we keep and learn from. How, even after we die, we are alive inside each other.”
		- “The understanding that no one’s going to find a good life for you, you have to find it for yourself. You have to live it to the best of your ability, to the best of your knowledge”
		- “Heartbreak is too tailored and too sprawling for comparison to be of use to anyone”
		- “ For me, it’s partly selfish. It felt good to sit and listen to someone, to disappear into their thoughts and not to be left with my own. It is helpful and healing to try to help others.”
		- “One particularly painful echo of loss is loneliness. The feeling that everyone else lives in a different, happier world, and you are stuck outside its window, looking in, unable to participate. ”
		- “Every time I formed a firm opinion, another answer reshaped it. This process was a lesson in itself: however many conversations on love I had, I would never find a fixed set of responses to its challenges. ”
		- “When someone’s dying, time goes away and your life and your love and your relationships are there all at once, in that hospital room, in those minutes. Moments like that become part of your memory. They open up your heart in a new way.”
		- “there are three sources of meaning: love (for humans and for experiences, like a sunset), purposeful work (what you’re trying to do in and for the world), and the courage you find in the face of difficulty. It’s not just about sitting around loving each other; the way you respond to unavoidable suffering is also a source of meaning.”
		- “There’s an essay by a doctor, Diane E. Meier, called ‘I Don’t Want Jenny to Think I’m Abandoning Her’, which talks about how sometimes we doctors use treatments, even relentless chemotherapy, as a way to show love to our patients. But how we learn over time that just sitting with people when they’re suffering, or visiting them when they’re dying, is a love that patients often want.”
		- “ Witnessing is a treatment and a form of love.”
		- “suddenly you’re a different person too, because your future self is no longer there. At the same time, I do think there’s an essential self, and it’s worthwhile to realize that we are still ourselves, even with no future. But it takes a second to remember that.”
		- “People die. Hearts break. We love and we lose. And then we have to summon the courage to reckon with our losses and get back up, knowing there is no assurance we won’t get knocked down again.”
		- “Wouldn’t disappointment hurt less if I never truly believed in a happy outcome in the first place?”
		- “It’s hard to see clearly what you learn from what you lose. At first, I thought the lesson of my loss was to protect myself from a similar ambush in the future, by holding back love. And now? I see that the uncertainty love requires is not a problem to be fixed; it is what makes it beautiful. It invites courage. It asks us to hope, without evidence, without knowing.”
		- “All of love requires a risk, a moment where we have to decide to say, ‘I’m all in,’ even if we’ve been hurt before.”
		- “We see other people’s losses as terrible, faraway things; we say we can’t imagine them, but we must. It is the only way we will get better at saying, ‘I’m sorry.’
		- We do have this capacity, I had learnt, to be there for people we do not know. ”
		- “Love is a choice – and sometimes it’s choosing to love someone even when we don’t feel lovingly towards them.”
		- “I’d convinced myself that people who loved each other were drawn together like magnets, no matter what. But when distances like these emerge in our relationships, romantic or otherwise, we can’t wait for a mystical, gravitational force to close the gap – instead we have to create that force ourselves, with honesty and empathy and forgiveness.”
		- “We have to remember to keep up the little acts that say ‘I’m here’: to post the birthday card, to look into someone’s eyes, to call, to kiss, to hug, to ask questions and to say ‘I love you’ – and not in a throwaway way. Then to remember the big things: to tell the truth, to accept impermanence, to retain separateness, to see beyond ourselves, to understand that, although other people’s flaws are annoying, so are ours; and to keep catching ourselves. By ‘catching ourselves’ I mean tapping into a self-awareness that allows us to pull back from a mistake while we are making it.”
